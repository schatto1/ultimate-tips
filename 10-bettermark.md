# Building a Better Mark (Robyn Fennig)

## Extra: Using Hudl Technique
If you have a device that is compatible with the iTunes or Google Play stores, you should download Hudl Technique, a free app available to record movements in slow motion. I like this app because, in addition to being free, it is really easy to share videos with other people who use the app (teammates and coaches), and make notes/drawings. There are “Pay in app” features that I have never used, so you shouldn’t have to pay for anything.

Here’s the website:

https://www.hudl.com/products/technique

This is the FAQ/help site that explains how to use the app: https://www.hudl.com/support/technique

Areas I’d suggest you read if you need help using the app:

- Create a Hudl Technique Account
- Record a Video
- Import a Video from Camera Roll or Gallery
- Tag and Share Videos (this is how you can share videos with me and I can comment on form and help make notes!)


### week 1 session 1 - Building an Athletic Base
## Day 1: Establishing our “Marking Base”
Before we can move forward, I want to explain what we’re going to look for in marking positioning, starting from the ground up. Let’s all build the same “marking base” before we try to move.

**Stance**: feet slightly wider than shoulder width apart

**Weight**: evenly distributed between both feet/legs, slightly shifted forward onto the balls of your feet

**Knees**: in line with your toes, slight bend in your knees

**Hips**: shifted back. Neutral spine

**Shoulders**: slightly in front of your knees/toes

**Chest**: open to face the thrower

**Arms**: Out wide, slight bend in the elbow

**Hands**: open to the thrower

**Eyes**: up at the thrower

### Drill 1: Athletic Marking Base Hold
Hold your athletic marking base for 30 seconds on, 10-30 seconds off, repeat 5 times

### Drill 5: Fast Feet in Place

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YT0VpR7Wdc

Side View

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmJuilHv-mo

Standing in your marking base, chop your feet as quickly as you can for 10 seconds. Your goal is to get as many ground contacts as you possibly can in that 10 seconds. Rest for 10 seconds. Repeat 3 times.


Why are we practicing this base so much?

We want to make sure our base is strong before we drill movement. If our base is not strong and we start moving, our movement patterns will not be strong either! Our goal is for you to move efficiently and effectively -- everything about marking comes from this base. Let’s be as flawless as we can with this base before we start moving.

### week 1 session 2 - Lateral Change of Direction
## Day 2: Basics of Lateral Change of Direction
Before we can start drilling at game speed and getting really good at marking, we need to clean up our change of directions. The closer we are to the disc, the more efficient we need to be at changing directions as a defender to take space away (and we can’t get any closer than on the mark!). Today’s drills might seem simple, but they are tiring. The best players work on making their changes of direction efficient, explosive and quick.


You will need two cones (or any two items like shoes, water bottles, etc.) to mark distances and lines.

### Drill 1: Fast Feet in Place

Standing in your marking base, chop your feet as quickly as you can for 10 seconds. Your goal is to get as many ground contacts as you possibly can in that 10 seconds. Rest for 10 seconds. Repeat 3 times.

### Drill 2: Fast Feet Shuffle

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPZq9BbmmVY


Standing in your marking base, you’re going to do the fast feet drill, but this time you’ll be shuffling between two cones at about 5 yards (4.5 meters) apart. Your goal is to chop your feet as quickly as you can for 10 seconds as you move from cone to cone, maximizing the number of ground contacts while moving laterally from cone to cone. . Rest for 10 seconds. Repeat 4 times; alternate which direction you start. Do 2 where you start toward the left and 2 where you start toward the right.

### Drill 3: Single Leg Replacement Hops

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF6vIAcM2mI

Side View

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEYZ-9TkZe4

Standing with one foot on a line, get into your athletic marking base. Shift your weight toward the foot on the line. Hop straight up, and switch which leg is on the line. Your goal is to keep your weight predominantly over the line. This means you will alternate which leg has most of your weight on it. Do 10 hops on each leg, or 20 hops total, pausing for 2-3 seconds in between hops.

Check in on your form between each rep. Things to look for:

- Is my knee over my toe and shoulders slightly in front of my knees/toes?
- Is my chest open and are my eyes up?
- Is the foot that isn’t on the line creeping too far away?
- Do I feel like I’m in an athletic/comfortable position?

Take time to correct your form before you hop to the other leg!

### Drill 4: Double Leg Line Hops

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJWHR04T3Zk

Side View

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJPIxuNUH3A

Standing with one foot on a line, get into your athletic marking base. This time, your weight should be more evenly distributed, with slightly more on the foot that is on the line (60-70% of your weight on the foot on the line, 30-40% of your weight on the foot off the line). Jump straight up and land in your athletic marking base, switching which foot lands on the line. Your goal is to keep your weight 60-70% over the line. Just like the single leg replacement hop, you will alternate which leg lands on the line with more weight on it. Do 10 hops on each leg, or 20 hops total, pausing for 2-3 seconds in between hops.

Check in on your form between each rep. Things to look for:

- Is my knee over my toe and shoulders slightly in front of my knees/toes?
- Is my chest open and eyes up?
- Is the foot that isn’t on the line creeping too far away?
- Do I feel like I’m in an athletic/comfortable position?

Take time to correct your form before you hop to the other leg!

**Why are we shifting our weight now? I thought you said NOT to shift your weight?!**

We do need to shift our weight slightly when we change directions (it’s physics!); however, we want to make the movement efficient and safe. Let’s say we are moving from right to left. Once we get as far as we want to go to the left, we need to decelerate, stop, and accelerate to the right. We can do this in two different ways:

1. Decelerate with our weight more on our left foot. Stop, and explode our weight off of our left foot toward the right. **THIS IS NOT GOOD.** It puts a lot of stress on our left leg and leg joints and gets us in a position where we can more-easily hurt ourselves, as well as it is very inefficient.
2. Decelerate with our weight more on our right foot. Stop, and explode our weight off of both feet toward the right. **THIS IS GOOD.** By having our weight on the “inside” (in this case right leg) leg, we can use the outside leg to help push/explode in the other direction. Here, we can be more explosive and efficient!
We want to make sure that our knees do NOT buckle inward when we change directions.

Place two cones about 5 yards or 4.5 meters away from each other. Standing in your athletic marking base in front of one cone, side shuffle to the other cone. Focus on decelerating and shifting your weight toward the inside leg away from the cone you’re shuffling toward. Pause and take a look at your form. Are you loading your inside leg? Is your outside foot too far away or is it in a good base? Are your knees and toes still in line? Are your shoulders slightly in front of your knees/toes? Check in on your form, correct anything that needs a quick fix and reset. Repeat toward the other side. Do 5 reps going toward each cone.

Keep the same setup as the previous drill. Standing in your athletic marking base in front of one cone, side shuffle to the other cone and immediately change directions toward the first cone. Once you get to the first cone you started at, pause (like in the previous drill).

Focus on decelerating and shifting your weight toward the inside leg away from the cone you’re shuffling toward. When you pause at the end, take a look at your form. Are you loading your inside leg? Is your outside foot too far away or is it in a good base? Are your knees and toes still in line? Are your shoulders slightly in front of your knees/toes? Check in on your form, correct anything that needs a quick fix and reset. Repeat toward the other side. Do 5 reps going toward each cone.

Do the same drill set up as the “Side Shuffle with Pause,” except this time add a reach when you get to the end. You’re trying to block a high release, low release or standard release throw as you’re pausing. Your goal is to be able to reach without letting your weight shift to your outside leg.

# week 2 session 1 - Flat Mark Strategy

Today is all about changing directions. Last week, we focused in on the basics of building a mark and setting the stage for quick, shuffling work. Today’s workout is all about shuffling and putting together what is a “flat” marking strategy. In a flat marking strategy, we are shuffling along a single plane. In this case, it’s a straight line. Obviously, getting really good and efficient at shuffling in a line will serve us well in a flat mark!

We’re going to warm-up with some of our fast feet movements to get us ready to move laterally in a quick, efficient way.

**Equipment:**

-3 cones

## Warm-up Circuit

Go through **each exercise from Week 1.**

Go two times in a row, and on to the next exercise. Repeat the circuit two times.

**Warm-up Drill 1: Fast Feet in Place (2x per circuit)**

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-YT0VpR7Wdc?rel=0" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" style="box-sizing: border-box; position: absolute; top: 0px; bottom: 0px; left: 0px; width: 640px; height: 360px; border: 0px; background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"></iframe>



Standing in your marking base, chop your feet as quickly as you can for 10 seconds. Your goal is to get as many ground contacts as you possibly can in that 10 seconds. Rest for 10 seconds. Repeat.

**Warm-up Drill 2: Fast Feet Shuffle (2x per circuit)**



<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UvgZCVcsReA?rel=0" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" style="box-sizing: border-box; position: absolute; top: 0px; bottom: 0px; left: 0px; width: 640px; height: 360px; border: 0px; background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"></iframe>



Standing in your marking base, you’re going to do the fast feet drill, but this time you’ll be shuffling between two cones at about 5 yards (4.5 meters) apart. Your goal is to chop your feet as quickly as you can for 10 seconds as you move from cone to cone, maximizing the number of ground contacts while moving laterally from cone to cone. Alternate which direction you start. Do 1 where you start toward the left and 1 where you start toward the right.

**Warm-up Drill 3: Single Leg Replacement Hops (20 jumps per circuit)**



<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XF6vIAcM2mI?rel=0" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" style="box-sizing: border-box; position: absolute; top: 0px; bottom: 0px; left: 0px; width: 640px; height: 360px; border: 0px; background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"></iframe>



Standing with one foot on a line, get into your athletic marking base. Shift your weight toward the foot on the line. Hop straight up, and switch which leg is on the line. Your goal is to keep your weight predominantly over the line. This means you will alternate which leg has most of your weight on it. Do 10 hops on each leg, or 20 hops total, per each set, pausing for 2-3 seconds in between hops.

## Drilling:

We want to get efficient at shuffling. Our first drill is a repeat from our last session.

###  Drill 1: 5 yard (4.5 meter) Side Shuffle with Pause and Reach



<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GcyU5FrmcPY?rel=0" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" style="box-sizing: border-box; position: absolute; top: 0px; bottom: 0px; left: 0px; width: 640px; height: 360px; border: 0px; background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"></iframe>



Set up two cones/items to mark off 5 yards or 4.5 meters. You’ll side shuffle from one object to the other, and reach/pause. (Remember, you’re visualizing reaching to block a high release, low release or standard “around” throw at that cone). Focus on minimizing weight shifts. Your goal is to be able to reach without letting your weight shift to your outside leg. Things to add today:

- Reaching higher in your high release “blocking” - try not to come up on your toes
- Getting lower to block a low release throw - sit down lower and reach out wider when you get to the cone
- Explosively pushing off with both legs/feet when you change directions after the pause

**Repeat this so you go 8x each way (8x to the left, 8x to the right)**

##  Flat Mark Concepts

We will introduce one of two main marking styles this week: The Flat Mark. In our flat mark, we can position ourselves in one of two ways:

###  45 degree flat mark:

 ![img](https://s3.amazonaws.com/kajabi-storefronts-production/products/65913/images/MyfTGTRyRv2JHhmubnoQ_flatmark45.png)

The diagram above depicts the 45 degree flat mark. The mark positions him or herself at a 45 degree angle and chops their feet/moves along the gray line. The mark is a bit farther away than most people typically set up (think an arm’s length away, slightly more if you have short arms). Your responsibility aligns more closely with what most of us are taught on the mark. We are limiting one half of the field, and focusing on chopping our feet to take away the inside passing lane and the around passing lane, while blocking throws with our bodies to most of the break side.

###  True Flat Mark

 ![img](https://s3.amazonaws.com/kajabi-storefronts-production/products/65913/images/9simeM0GRtygwb8Jtfnj_trueflatmark.png)

The marker in a “True” flat mark, is perpendicular to the sideline, with his/her sternum (center of chest) even with the thrower’s force side shoulder. The mark shifts farther toward the break side, with the goal of forcing close throws to be even or behind the mark, or upfield throws to be big, loopy around (outside-in edge) throws, giving defenders ample time to challenge the passing lane.


In both diagrams, the gray dashed line represents the plane on which the thrower moves. In a 45 degree flat mark, the marker covers equal amounts of space on the inside and around throws; in a True flat mark, the marker covers more space on the break side, and less space on the open/inside break area.

###  Drill 5-  True Flat Mark Shuffle

Keeping your two cones set up and add a third cone to represent the open side shoulder/pivot foot), you’ll focus in on shuffling laterally along a “flat mark plane.” The video below sets up a True flat mark scenario. Note that I’m standing closer to one cone (that represents the open or forehand side).



<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EEr2OyD9EWQ?rel=0" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" style="box-sizing: border-box; position: absolute; top: 0px; bottom: 0px; left: 0px; width: 640px; height: 360px; border: 0px; background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"></iframe>




You can see my stance/positioning from the side as well:



<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8tk-fbjydJQ?rel=0" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" style="box-sizing: border-box; position: absolute; top: 0px; bottom: 0px; left: 0px; width: 640px; height: 360px; border: 0px; background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"></iframe>




Here’s a demo of the backhand side of this drill too.



<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s4mz8J4vrI8?rel=0" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" style="box-sizing: border-box; position: absolute; top: 0px; bottom: 0px; left: 0px; width: 640px; height: 360px; border: 0px; background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"></iframe>




**Do the drill 8 times forehand, and 8 times backhand.**

###  Drill 6 - 45 Degree Flat Mark Shuffle

You’ll essentially do the same thing as Drill 5, except you’ll get reps where you’re visualizing the 45 degree flat mark. This means you are shuffling to challenge an equal amount of space to inside and around break lanes. In other words, repeat Drill 5 with “forehand” and “backhand” forces, except for the third cone is evenly placed between the two marker cones, like this (in essence, you move cone C in the center of the diagram to set up the two flat mark drills)

 ![img](https://s3.amazonaws.com/kajabi-storefronts-production/products/65913/images/VjhhEkALQduJHSSoyHwi_drill6conesetup.png)

**Go through 8x with each force**

 

### Drill 7 - 20 seconds of marking:

You’ll work for 20 seconds nonstop in the two various marking schemes using this pattern so you drill home resetting to the pivot point (i.e. where cone C is)

45 degree marking shuffle -

 ![img](https://s3.amazonaws.com/kajabi-storefronts-production/products/65913/images/PiUIFyIUQUSs8owjyeAf_drill7conesetup.png)

Shuffle from A → C→ A→ C→ B → C → B → C  and repeat for the rest of your time. You’re essentially shuffling from the center, to a side, and back, two consecutive times. Then you repeat toward the opposite direction.


**Do 2 reps with a forehand force, 2 with a backhand force in both of the flat marking schemes (True and 45 degree).**

##  Recap

To complete this session you're doing:

**Drill 5 - True Flat Mark Shuffle:**

- 8x Forehand
- 8x Backhand

**Drill 6 - 45 Degree Flat Mark Shuffle:**

- 8x Forehand
