# Building a Better Mark (Robyn Fennig)

## Extra: Using Hudl Technique
If you have a device that is compatible with the iTunes or Google Play stores, you should download Hudl Technique, a free app available to record movements in slow motion. I like this app because, in addition to being free, it is really easy to share videos with other people who use the app (teammates and coaches), and make notes/drawings. There are “Pay in app” features that I have never used, so you shouldn’t have to pay for anything.

Here’s the website:

https://www.hudl.com/products/technique

This is the FAQ/help site that explains how to use the app: https://www.hudl.com/support/technique

Areas I’d suggest you read if you need help using the app:

- Create a Hudl Technique Account
- Record a Video
- Import a Video from Camera Roll or Gallery
- Tag and Share Videos (this is how you can share videos with me and I can comment on form and help make notes!)


### week 1 session 1 - Building an Athletic Base
## Day 1: Establishing our “Marking Base”
Before we can move forward, I want to explain what we’re going to look for in marking positioning, starting from the ground up. Let’s all build the same “marking base” before we try to move.

**Stance**: feet slightly wider than shoulder width apart

**Weight**: evenly distributed between both feet/legs, slightly shifted forward onto the balls of your feet

**Knees**: in line with your toes, slight bend in your knees

**Hips**: shifted back. Neutral spine

**Shoulders**: slightly in front of your knees/toes

**Chest**: open to face the thrower

**Arms**: Out wide, slight bend in the elbow

**Hands**: open to the thrower

**Eyes**: up at the thrower

### Drill 1: Athletic Marking Base Hold
Hold your athletic marking base for 30 seconds on, 10-30 seconds off, repeat 5 times

### Drill 5: Fast Feet in Place

Standing in your marking base, chop your feet as quickly as you can for 10 seconds. Your goal is to get as many ground contacts as you possibly can in that 10 seconds. Rest for 10 seconds. Repeat 3 times.


Why are we practicing this base so much?

We want to make sure our base is strong before we drill movement. If our base is not strong and we start moving, our movement patterns will not be strong either! Our goal is for you to move efficiently and effectively -- everything about marking comes from this base. Let’s be as flawless as we can with this base before we start moving.

### week 1 session 2 - Lateral Change of Direction
## Day 2: Basics of Lateral Change of Direction
Before we can start drilling at game speed and getting really good at marking, we need to clean up our change of directions. The closer we are to the disc, the more efficient we need to be at changing directions as a defender to take space away (and we can’t get any closer than on the mark!). Today’s drills might seem simple, but they are tiring. The best players work on making their changes of direction efficient, explosive and quick.


You will need two cones (or any two items like shoes, water bottles, etc.) to mark distances and lines.

### Drill 2: Fast Feet Shuffle

Standing in your marking base, you’re going to do the fast feet drill, but this time you’ll be shuffling between two cones at about 5 yards (4.5 meters) apart. Your goal is to chop your feet as quickly as you can for 10 seconds as you move from cone to cone, maximizing the number of ground contacts while moving laterally from cone to cone. . Rest for 10 seconds. Repeat 4 times; alternate which direction you start. Do 2 where you start toward the left and 2 where you start toward the right.

### Drill 3: Single Leg Replacement Hops

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEYZ-9TkZe4

Standing with one foot on a line, get into your athletic marking base. Shift your weight toward the foot on the line. Hop straight up, and switch which leg is on the line. Your goal is to keep your weight predominantly over the line. This means you will alternate which leg has most of your weight on it. Do 10 hops on each leg, or 20 hops total, pausing for 2-3 seconds in between hops.

Check in on your form between each rep. Things to look for:

- Is my knee over my toe and shoulders slightly in front of my knees/toes?
- Is my chest open and are my eyes up?
- Is the foot that isn’t on the line creeping too far away?
- Do I feel like I’m in an athletic/comfortable position?

Take time to correct your form before you hop to the other leg!

### Drill 4: Double Leg Line Hops

Standing with one foot on a line, get into your athletic marking base. This time, your weight should be more evenly distributed, with slightly more on the foot that is on the line (60-70% of your weight on the foot on the line, 30-40% of your weight on the foot off the line). Jump straight up and land in your athletic marking base, switching which foot lands on the line. Your goal is to keep your weight 60-70% over the line. Just like the single leg replacement hop, you will alternate which leg lands on the line with more weight on it. Do 10 hops on each leg, or 20 hops total, pausing for 2-3 seconds in between hops.

Check in on your form between each rep. Things to look for:

- Is my knee over my toe and shoulders slightly in front of my knees/toes?
- Is my chest open and eyes up?
- Is the foot that isn’t on the line creeping too far away?
- Do I feel like I’m in an athletic/comfortable position?

Take time to correct your form before you hop to the other leg!

**Why are we shifting our weight now? I thought you said NOT to shift your weight?!**

We do need to shift our weight slightly when we change directions (it’s physics!); however, we want to make the movement efficient and safe. Let’s say we are moving from right to left. Once we get as far as we want to go to the left, we need to decelerate, stop, and accelerate to the right. We can do this in two different ways:

1. Decelerate with our weight more on our left foot. Stop, and explode our weight off of our left foot toward the right. **THIS IS NOT GOOD.** It puts a lot of stress on our left leg and leg joints and gets us in a position where we can more-easily hurt ourselves, as well as it is very inefficient.
2. Decelerate with our weight more on our right foot. Stop, and explode our weight off of both feet toward the right. **THIS IS GOOD.** By having our weight on the “inside” (in this case right leg) leg, we can use the outside leg to help push/explode in the other direction. Here, we can be more explosive and efficient!
We want to make sure that our knees do NOT buckle inward when we change directions.

Place two cones about 5 yards or 4.5 meters away from each other. Standing in your athletic marking base in front of one cone, side shuffle to the other cone. Focus on decelerating and shifting your weight toward the inside leg away from the cone you’re shuffling toward. Pause and take a look at your form. Are you loading your inside leg? Is your outside foot too far away or is it in a good base? Are your knees and toes still in line? Are your shoulders slightly in front of your knees/toes? Check in on your form, correct anything that needs a quick fix and reset. Repeat toward the other side. Do 5 reps going toward each cone.

Keep the same setup as the previous drill. Standing in your athletic marking base in front of one cone, side shuffle to the other cone and immediately change directions toward the first cone. Once you get to the first cone you started at, pause (like in the previous drill).

Focus on decelerating and shifting your weight toward the inside leg away from the cone you’re shuffling toward. When you pause at the end, take a look at your form. Are you loading your inside leg? Is your outside foot too far away or is it in a good base? Are your knees and toes still in line? Are your shoulders slightly in front of your knees/toes? Check in on your form, correct anything that needs a quick fix and reset. Repeat toward the other side. Do 5 reps going toward each cone.

### Assignment!

Do the same drill set up as the “Side Shuffle with Pause,” except this time add a reach when you get to the end. You’re trying to block a high release, low release or standard release throw as you’re pausing. Your goal is to be able to reach without letting your weight shift to your outside leg.
