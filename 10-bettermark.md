# Building a Better Mark (Robyn Fennig)

# Extra: Using Hudl Technique

If you have a device that is compatible with the iTunes or Google Play stores, you should download Hudl Technique, a free app available to record movements in slow motion. I like this app because, in addition to being free, it is really easy to share videos with other people who use the app (teammates and coaches), and make notes/drawings. There are “Pay in app” features that I have never used, so you shouldn’t have to pay for anything.

Here’s the website:

https://www.hudl.com/products/technique

This is the FAQ/help site that explains how to use the app: https://www.hudl.com/support/technique

Areas I’d suggest you read if you need help using the app:

- Create a Hudl Technique Account
- Record a Video
- Import a Video from Camera Roll or Gallery
- Tag and Share Videos (this is how you can share videos with me and I can comment on form and help make notes!)

# week 1 session 1 - Building an Athletic Base

## Day 1: Establishing our “Marking Base”

Before we can move forward, I want to explain what we’re going to look for in marking positioning, starting from the ground up. Let’s all build the same “marking base” before we try to move.

**Stance**: feet slightly wider than shoulder width apart

**Weight**: evenly distributed between both feet/legs, slightly shifted forward onto the balls of your feet

**Knees**: in line with your toes, slight bend in your knees

**Hips**: shifted back. Neutral spine

**Shoulders**: slightly in front of your knees/toes

**Chest**: open to face the thrower

**Arms**: Out wide, slight bend in the elbow

**Hands**: open to the thrower

**Eyes**: up at the thrower

### Drill 1: Athletic Marking Base Hold
Hold your athletic marking base for 30 seconds on, 10-30 seconds off, repeat 5 times

### Drill 5: Fast Feet in Place

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YT0VpR7Wdc

Side View

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmJuilHv-mo

Standing in your marking base, chop your feet as quickly as you can for 10 seconds. Your goal is to get as many ground contacts as you possibly can in that 10 seconds. Rest for 10 seconds. Repeat 3 times.


Why are we practicing this base so much?

We want to make sure our base is strong before we drill movement. If our base is not strong and we start moving, our movement patterns will not be strong either! Our goal is for you to move efficiently and effectively -- everything about marking comes from this base. Let’s be as flawless as we can with this base before we start moving.

### week 1 session 2 - Lateral Change of Direction
## Day 2: Basics of Lateral Change of Direction
Before we can start drilling at game speed and getting really good at marking, we need to clean up our change of directions. The closer we are to the disc, the more efficient we need to be at changing directions as a defender to take space away (and we can’t get any closer than on the mark!). Today’s drills might seem simple, but they are tiring. The best players work on making their changes of direction efficient, explosive and quick.


You will need two cones (or any two items like shoes, water bottles, etc.) to mark distances and lines.

### Drill 1: Fast Feet in Place

Standing in your marking base, chop your feet as quickly as you can for 10 seconds. Your goal is to get as many ground contacts as you possibly can in that 10 seconds. Rest for 10 seconds. Repeat 3 times.

### Drill 2: Fast Feet Shuffle

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvgZCVcsReA

Side View

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPZq9BbmmVY


Standing in your marking base, you’re going to do the fast feet drill, but this time you’ll be shuffling between two cones at about 5 yards (4.5 meters) apart. Your goal is to chop your feet as quickly as you can for 10 seconds as you move from cone to cone, maximizing the number of ground contacts while moving laterally from cone to cone. . Rest for 10 seconds. Repeat 4 times; alternate which direction you start. Do 2 where you start toward the left and 2 where you start toward the right.

### Drill 3: Single Leg Replacement Hops

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF6vIAcM2mI

Side View

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEYZ-9TkZe4

Standing with one foot on a line, get into your athletic marking base. Shift your weight toward the foot on the line. Hop straight up, and switch which leg is on the line. Your goal is to keep your weight predominantly over the line. This means you will alternate which leg has most of your weight on it. Do 10 hops on each leg, or 20 hops total, pausing for 2-3 seconds in between hops.

Check in on your form between each rep. Things to look for:

- Is my knee over my toe and shoulders slightly in front of my knees/toes?
- Is my chest open and are my eyes up?
- Is the foot that isn’t on the line creeping too far away?
- Do I feel like I’m in an athletic/comfortable position?

Take time to correct your form before you hop to the other leg!

### Drill 4: Double Leg Line Hops

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJWHR04T3Zk

Side View

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJPIxuNUH3A

Standing with one foot on a line, get into your athletic marking base. This time, your weight should be more evenly distributed, with slightly more on the foot that is on the line (60-70% of your weight on the foot on the line, 30-40% of your weight on the foot off the line). Jump straight up and land in your athletic marking base, switching which foot lands on the line. Your goal is to keep your weight 60-70% over the line. Just like the single leg replacement hop, you will alternate which leg lands on the line with more weight on it. Do 10 hops on each leg, or 20 hops total, pausing for 2-3 seconds in between hops.

Check in on your form between each rep. Things to look for:

- Is my knee over my toe and shoulders slightly in front of my knees/toes?
- Is my chest open and eyes up?
- Is the foot that isn’t on the line creeping too far away?
- Do I feel like I’m in an athletic/comfortable position?

Take time to correct your form before you hop to the other leg!

**Why are we shifting our weight now? I thought you said NOT to shift your weight?!**

We do need to shift our weight slightly when we change directions (it’s physics!); however, we want to make the movement efficient and safe. Let’s say we are moving from right to left. Once we get as far as we want to go to the left, we need to decelerate, stop, and accelerate to the right. We can do this in two different ways:

1. Decelerate with our weight more on our left foot. Stop, and explode our weight off of our left foot toward the right. **THIS IS NOT GOOD.** It puts a lot of stress on our left leg and leg joints and gets us in a position where we can more-easily hurt ourselves, as well as it is very inefficient.
2. Decelerate with our weight more on our right foot. Stop, and explode our weight off of both feet toward the right. **THIS IS GOOD.** By having our weight on the “inside” (in this case right leg) leg, we can use the outside leg to help push/explode in the other direction. Here, we can be more explosive and efficient!
We want to make sure that our knees do NOT buckle inward when we change directions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eW7aRbWUXzo

Place two cones about 5 yards or 4.5 meters away from each other. Standing in your athletic marking base in front of one cone, side shuffle to the other cone. Focus on decelerating and shifting your weight toward the inside leg away from the cone you’re shuffling toward. Pause and take a look at your form. Are you loading your inside leg? Is your outside foot too far away or is it in a good base? Are your knees and toes still in line? Are your shoulders slightly in front of your knees/toes? Check in on your form, correct anything that needs a quick fix and reset. Repeat toward the other side. Do 5 reps going toward each cone.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LE1ryrqjMdQ

Keep the same setup as the previous drill. Standing in your athletic marking base in front of one cone, side shuffle to the other cone and immediately change directions toward the first cone. Once you get to the first cone you started at, pause (like in the previous drill).

Focus on decelerating and shifting your weight toward the inside leg away from the cone you’re shuffling toward. When you pause at the end, take a look at your form. Are you loading your inside leg? Is your outside foot too far away or is it in a good base? Are your knees and toes still in line? Are your shoulders slightly in front of your knees/toes? Check in on your form, correct anything that needs a quick fix and reset. Repeat toward the other side. Do 5 reps going toward each cone.

# week 2 session 1 - Flat Mark Strategy

Today is all about changing directions. Last week, we focused in on the basics of building a mark and setting the stage for quick, shuffling work. Today’s workout is all about shuffling and putting together what is a “flat” marking strategy. In a flat marking strategy, we are shuffling along a single plane. In this case, it’s a straight line. Obviously, getting really good and efficient at shuffling in a line will serve us well in a flat mark!

We’re going to warm-up with some of our fast feet movements to get us ready to move laterally in a quick, efficient way.

**Equipment:**

-3 cones

## Warm-up Circuit

Go through **each exercise from Week 1.**

Go two times in a row, and on to the next exercise. Repeat the circuit two times.

**Warm-up Drill 1: Fast Feet in Place (2x per circuit)**

https://www.youtube.com/embed/-YT0VpR7Wdc?rel=0

Standing in your marking base, chop your feet as quickly as you can for 10 seconds. Your goal is to get as many ground contacts as you possibly can in that 10 seconds. Rest for 10 seconds. Repeat.

**Warm-up Drill 2: Fast Feet Shuffle (2x per circuit)**

https://www.youtube.com/embed/UvgZCVcsReA?rel=0

Standing in your marking base, you’re going to do the fast feet drill, but this time you’ll be shuffling between two cones at about 5 yards (4.5 meters) apart. Your goal is to chop your feet as quickly as you can for 10 seconds as you move from cone to cone, maximizing the number of ground contacts while moving laterally from cone to cone. Alternate which direction you start. Do 1 where you start toward the left and 1 where you start toward the right.

**Warm-up Drill 3: Single Leg Replacement Hops (20 jumps per circuit)**

https://www.youtube.com/embed/XF6vIAcM2mI?rel=0

Standing with one foot on a line, get into your athletic marking base. Shift your weight toward the foot on the line. Hop straight up, and switch which leg is on the line. Your goal is to keep your weight predominantly over the line. This means you will alternate which leg has most of your weight on it. Do 10 hops on each leg, or 20 hops total, per each set, pausing for 2-3 seconds in between hops.

## Drilling:

We want to get efficient at shuffling. Our first drill is a repeat from our last session.

###  Drill 1: 5 yard (4.5 meter) Side Shuffle with Pause and Reach

https://www.youtube.com/embed/GcyU5FrmcPY?rel=0

Set up two cones/items to mark off 5 yards or 4.5 meters. You’ll side shuffle from one object to the other, and reach/pause. (Remember, you’re visualizing reaching to block a high release, low release or standard “around” throw at that cone). Focus on minimizing weight shifts. Your goal is to be able to reach without letting your weight shift to your outside leg. Things to add today:

- Reaching higher in your high release “blocking” - try not to come up on your toes
- Getting lower to block a low release throw - sit down lower and reach out wider when you get to the cone
- Explosively pushing off with both legs/feet when you change directions after the pause

**Repeat this so you go 8x each way (8x to the left, 8x to the right)**

##  Flat Mark Concepts

We will introduce one of two main marking styles this week: The Flat Mark. In our flat mark, we can position ourselves in one of two ways:

###  45 degree flat mark:

 ![img](https://s3.amazonaws.com/kajabi-storefronts-production/products/65913/images/MyfTGTRyRv2JHhmubnoQ_flatmark45.png)

The diagram above depicts the 45 degree flat mark. The mark positions him or herself at a 45 degree angle and chops their feet/moves along the gray line. The mark is a bit farther away than most people typically set up (think an arm’s length away, slightly more if you have short arms). Your responsibility aligns more closely with what most of us are taught on the mark. We are limiting one half of the field, and focusing on chopping our feet to take away the inside passing lane and the around passing lane, while blocking throws with our bodies to most of the break side.

###  True Flat Mark

 ![img](https://s3.amazonaws.com/kajabi-storefronts-production/products/65913/images/9simeM0GRtygwb8Jtfnj_trueflatmark.png)

The marker in a “True” flat mark, is perpendicular to the sideline, with his/her sternum (center of chest) even with the thrower’s force side shoulder. The mark shifts farther toward the break side, with the goal of forcing close throws to be even or behind the mark, or upfield throws to be big, loopy around (outside-in edge) throws, giving defenders ample time to challenge the passing lane.


In both diagrams, the gray dashed line represents the plane on which the thrower moves. In a 45 degree flat mark, the marker covers equal amounts of space on the inside and around throws; in a True flat mark, the marker covers more space on the break side, and less space on the open/inside break area.

### Drill 5- True Flat Mark Shuffle

Keeping your two cones set up and add a third cone to represent the open side shoulder/pivot foot), you’ll focus in on shuffling laterally along a “flat mark plane.” The video below sets up a True flat mark scenario. Note that I’m standing closer to one cone (that represents the open or forehand side).

https://www.youtube.com/embed/EEr2OyD9EWQ?rel=0

You can see my stance/positioning from the side as well:

https://www.youtube.com/embed/8tk-fbjydJQ?rel=0

Here’s a demo of the backhand side of this drill too.

https://www.youtube.com/embed/s4mz8J4vrI8?rel=0

**Do the drill 8 times forehand, and 8 times backhand.**

###  Drill 6 - 45 Degree Flat Mark Shuffle

You’ll essentially do the same thing as Drill 5, except you’ll get reps where you’re visualizing the 45 degree flat mark. This means you are shuffling to challenge an equal amount of space to inside and around break lanes. In other words, repeat Drill 5 with “forehand” and “backhand” forces, except for the third cone is evenly placed between the two marker cones, like this (in essence, you move cone C in the center of the diagram to set up the two flat mark drills)

 ![img](https://s3.amazonaws.com/kajabi-storefronts-production/products/65913/images/VjhhEkALQduJHSSoyHwi_drill6conesetup.png)

**Go through 8x with each force**

 

### Drill 7 - 20 seconds of marking:

You’ll work for 20 seconds nonstop in the two various marking schemes using this pattern so you drill home resetting to the pivot point (i.e. where cone C is)

45 degree marking shuffle -

 ![img](https://s3.amazonaws.com/kajabi-storefronts-production/products/65913/images/PiUIFyIUQUSs8owjyeAf_drill7conesetup.png)

Shuffle from A → C→ A→ C→ B → C → B → C and repeat for the rest of your time. You’re essentially shuffling from the center, to a side, and back, two consecutive times. Then you repeat toward the opposite direction.


**Do 2 reps with a forehand force, 2 with a backhand force in both of the flat marking schemes (True and 45 degree).**

##  Recap

To complete this session you're doing:

**Drill 5 - True Flat Mark Shuffle:**

- 8x Forehand
- 8x Backhand

**Drill 6 - 45 Degree Flat Mark Shuffle:**

- 8x Forehand
- 8x Backhand

**Drill 7 - 20 seconds of Marking:**

- 2x 20 seconds on, 20 seconds off, backhand in True flat mark
- 2x 20 seconds on, 20 seconds off, forehand in True flat mark
- 2x 20 seconds on, 20 seconds off, backhand in 45 degree flat mark
- 2x 20 seconds on, 20 seconds off, forehand in 45 degree flat mark

**Repeat all the drills again (you can go through the circuit 2 or 3 times)**

# week 2 session 2 - Arm Action

Today, we start to incorporate reactive drills into our marking. We’ll start working on intentionally using our hands and reacting in our shuffles with the Flat Mark.

###  Equipment:

- 1 disc
- 1 partner
- 2 cones

## Warm-up Circuit

Go through **each exercise from Week 1.**

Go two times in a row, and on to the next exercise. Repeat the circuit two times.

**Warm-up Drill 1: Fast Feet in Place (2x per circuit)**

https://www.youtube.com/embed/-YT0VpR7Wdc?rel=0

Standing in your marking base, chop your feet as quickly as you can for 10 seconds. Your goal is to get as many ground contacts as you possibly can in that 10 seconds. Rest for 10 seconds. Repeat.

**Warm-up Drill 2: Fast Feet Shuffle (2x per circuit)**

https://www.youtube.com/embed/UvgZCVcsReA?rel=0

Standing in your marking base, you’re going to do the fast feet drill, but this time you’ll be shuffling between two cones at about 5 yards (4.5 meters) apart. Your goal is to chop your feet as quickly as you can for 10 seconds as you move from cone to cone, maximizing the number of ground contacts while moving laterally from cone to cone. Alternate which direction you start. Do 1 where you start toward the left and 1 where you start toward the right.

**Warm-up Drill 3: Single Leg Replacement Hops (20 jumps per circuit)**

https://www.youtube.com/embed/XF6vIAcM2mI?rel=0

Standing with one foot on a line, get into your athletic marking base. Shift your weight toward the foot on the line. Hop straight up, and switch which leg is on the line. Your goal is to keep your weight predominantly over the line. This means you will alternate which leg has most of your weight on it. Do 10 hops on each leg, or 20 hops total, per each set, pausing for 2-3 seconds in between hops.

## Reaching

We’re going to drill reaching on the mark. Our goal should be to move our hands quickly and look at the thrower’s eyes, all while minimizing our weight shifting. We should be able to reach quickly without shifting our weight at all


Think of your marking base as having four main throwing lanes: two above your arms and two below your arms. Each arm/hand can help limit those areas in your mark. Your goal is to be able to quickly hit each of those throwing lanes quickly without throwing off your balance -- that way when you limit one area, you’re ready to take away the next option a thrower looks toward.

### Reaching Drill 1 - Stationary Reaching at Slow Pace

https://www.youtube.com/embed/1ihSoCpmiTI?rel=0

Your partner holds a disc and slowly fakes in each throwing lane. Your goal is to stand in your athletic marking base. Go for a set amount of time (20-30 seconds) and switch with your partner.

### Reaching Drill 2 - Stationary Reaching at a Faster Pace

https://www.youtube.com/embed/7G9v9UP2tAI?rel=0

Same thing as in the previous drill, except your partner fakes more quickly. Do this twice each (you and your partner are on offense 2x and on defense 2x)

### Reaching Drill 3 - Live

https://www.youtube.com/embed/NCHFRK0Lkws?rel=0

Your partner is now pivoting and faking quickly, and you get to shuffle side to side while you’re reaching. Do a 10 second stall count. Do this three times (you and your partner each go 3x on offense)


Repeat the Reaching Drills with your partner 2-3 times.

## Assignment Bonus

Film your reaching exercises with Hudl Technique and watch them in slow motion. Are there ways that you can minimize weight shifting when you’re reaching?

# week 3 session 1 - Marking Rules and Violations

Before we can get into reacting on the mark at game speed and adding more difficult marking strategies, we need to know more about rules.


Today, we’re going to work on marking rules, violations, and fouls:

###  Link to WFDF Rules:

http://www.wfdf.org/news-media/news/press/2-official-communication/796-wfdf-announces-new-set-of-rules-of-ultimate-and-rules-appendix-2017

###  Link to USA Ultimate Rules:

http://www.usaultimate.org/resources/officiating/rules/11th_edition_rules.aspx

##  Scenarios to think through

Make sure you know what happens if there is a contested call and an uncontested call.

- Contact made during throw results in incompletion
- Contact made during throw results in completion
- Contact made with thrower (No throw)
- Disc knocked out of thrower’s hand
- Mark is within a disc’s width of thrower
- Two or more defenders are within 3m of thrower and responding to thrower
- Marker stalls with less than one second between counts
- Contact made by thrower (no throw)
- Thrower does not release the disc before 10 is reached in the stall count
- Marking player’s feet contains the thrower’s pivot point
- Line between marking player’s hands or arms wrap around the thrower’s pivot point
- Marker moves in a manner to intentionally block the thrower’s view of the field

For each of the above scenarios, what happens? What is the call? What should the discussion sound like? If the call is contested or uncontested, what is the stall count that the disc becomes live?

## Homework Assignment

### Answer at least one of the questions in the comments below!

What are some of the trickier/more difficult calls to discuss on the mark?

What are ways that you can position yourself to avoid these violations?

Are there any scenarios that you are unsure of?

Bonus: What is one difference between WFDF and USAU rules about marking?

# week 3 session 2 - Reactive Marking

### Equipment:

- 1 disc
- 1 partner
- 2 cones

## Warm-up Circuit

Go two times in a row, and on to the next exercise. Repeat the circuit two times.

**Warm-up Drill 1: Fast Feet in Place (2x per circuit)**

https://www.youtube.com/embed/-YT0VpR7Wdc?rel=0

Standing in your marking base, chop your feet as quickly as you can for 10 seconds. Your goal is to get as many ground contacts as you possibly can in that 10 seconds. Rest for 10 seconds. Repeat.

**Warm-up Drill 2: Fast Feet Shuffle (2x per circuit)**

https://www.youtube.com/embed/UvgZCVcsReA?rel=0

Standing in your marking base, you’re going to do the fast feet drill, but this time you’ll be shuffling between two cones at about 5 yards (4.5 meters) apart. Your goal is to chop your feet as quickly as you can for 10 seconds as you move from cone to cone, maximizing the number of ground contacts while moving laterally from cone to cone. Alternate which direction you start. Do 1 where you start toward the left and 1 where you start toward the right.

**Warm-up Drill 3: Single Leg Replacement Hops (20 jumps per circuit)**

https://www.youtube.com/embed/XF6vIAcM2mI?rel=0

Standing with one foot on a line, get into your athletic marking base. Shift your weight toward the foot on the line. Hop straight up, and switch which leg is on the line. Your goal is to keep your weight predominantly over the line. This means you will alternate which leg has most of your weight on it. Do 10 hops on each leg, or 20 hops total, per each set, pausing for 2-3 seconds in between hops.

**Warm-up Drill 4: Stationary Reaching (Fast!) (3x10 seconds)**

https://www.youtube.com/embed/7G9v9UP2tAI?rel=0

Your partner will pivot and fake quickly, and you will hold your athletic marking position for a 10 second stall count while practicing your reaching without shifting your weight. Your goal is to use your peripheral vision to see the disc while looking at the thrower’s eyes. Do this three times (you and your partner each go 3x on offense)

## Reactive Marking Drills with a Partner

Still working in the flat marking plane, we’ll work on reactive shuffling; we’ll move from more prescriptive to more “game-like” drills. It’s important for you to practice getting practices without communication and with communication, because in a game, you likely have a teammate talking to you while you’re on the mark.


There will be a partner dictating a lateral shuffle with their voice, a finger point, or a disc fake. Your job as that person is to be unpredictable. Don’t just alternate directions every time, keep your partner guessing!

###  Reacting to Pointing

Set up three cones, all of which are about 2.5 or 3 yards apart. Your partner should stand in line with the center cone about 5 yards away. Your partner will point to the left or to the right. You will react and shuffle to the outside cone, reach, and return to the center cone. Each time, focus on re-setting into your athletic marking base position. The partner who points should give his/her partner 1-2 seconds in the center position to reset and hold the marking base.

https://www.youtube.com/embed/GW4SoCx0WIM?rel=0

You can decide to do a set amount of time or set number of reps to each side, whatever works best for you and your partner. Repeat 3-5 times.

###  Reacting to Voice Cue

Same set-up as the “Pointing” drill, except the non-marking partner will yell out “left” or “right” (or you may yell “inside” or “around” if that makes more sense to you). The marking partner will shuffle to the outside cone, reach, and shuffle back to the middle.

https://www.youtube.com/embed/L00Uptlaow8?rel=0

Again, focus in on pausing/resetting in the middle for 1-2 seconds, before giving another command. Give feedback: is your partner changing directions quickly after reaching? Is the “reset” athletic marking base still on point?


You can decide to do a set number of reps, whatever works best for you and your partner! Do 3-5 reps.

###  Reacting to Disc Fakes

You will have a similar set-up, except this time, you will have your center cone in line with your partner’s pivot foot. In the flat marking strategy, you’re responsible for a bigger around lane and a smaller inside lane. You can see this in the video:

https://www.youtube.com/embed/zuLljGe4dEs?rel=0

You’ll notice Molly (defender in black) resets to the center cone every time and Anna (thrower in white) waits for Molly to reset before she pivots out toward one of the outside cones. You’ll also see that Anna is about 3-5 yards away from Molly. This is great, because it gives Molly more time to react (since this is just the first “reactive to a disc” drill that we are doing!).

Thrower should only pivot out to one direction, wait for the mark to get to the cone, and reset in the middle. Go for a 10 second stall count, and repeat 5 times each.

###  Reacting to Disc Fakes at Game-Speed

You will have a similar set-up, except this time, you are reacting to a live thrower with live fakes. The partner with the disc should pivot and fake as they would in a game. The mark works to contain options.

Go for a 10 second stall count, and repeat 5 times each.

#  Assignment:

Record the last drill with your partner and watch it together. Areas to focus in on:

Key points of your athletic marking base:

- Looking up at the thrower
- Reaching without shifting your weight (in your upper body)
- Shifting toward the inside leg when you change directions
- Explosive, efficient changes of directions

\1. Pinpoint **some of your strengths** on the mark. Share them with the group!
\2. Pinpoint **one thing you want to work on** improving in your mark (now that we’re going more quickly!)

# week 4 session 1 - Triangle Mark Strategy

Today, we introduce a new marking concept:

# The Triangle Mark

**What you need:**

- 3 cones
- Partner
- Disc

### The whole idea is that you:

1. Challenge the “shown throw,” which is the throw the person with the disc immediately positions themselves to throw (usually on the open side)
2. Take away the first break throw (usually the around break, since you typically have to be positioned on the inside lane to challenge a shown throw on the open side)
3. Take away the next throw (usually an inside break)
4. Re-position as necessary to the shown throw

**I like to think of my job as:**

- I take away the **shown** throw with my **hand**.
- I take away the **around** throw with my **body**.
- I take away the **inside** throw with my **shoulder**.


Things that I would like you to actively think about:

**1. Using your athletic marking base**

Any movements you use during our drills need to come from an athletic marking stance. When you shuffle, reach, etc. on the mark, you should emphasize doing it as efficiently as possible. The person demonstrating isn’t really thinking about his marking form (the video is to demonstrate the movement patterns and understand the concept). Just make sure you implement your athletic marking base :-)

**2. Not waving your hands randomly**

My marking philosophy varies from some in this regard (and that’s okay!). Being unpredictable with your hands doesn’t allow you to focus on taking certain spaces away. Your team likely has a strategy about which throws you want to force over others (high vs. low) based on how your downfield D plays. You should practice intentionally too!

We’re going to warm-up with some of our fast feet movements to get us ready to move laterally in a quick, efficient way.

##  Warm-up Circuit

Go through each exercise in our typical warm-up circuit. Go two times in a row, and on to the next exercise. Repeat the circuit two times.

**Drill 1: Fast Feet in Place**

https://www.youtube.com/embed/-YT0VpR7Wdc?rel=0

Side View

https://www.youtube.com/embed/SmJuilHv-mo?rel=0

Standing in your marking base, chop your feet as quickly as you can for 10 seconds. Your goal is to get as many ground contacts as you possibly can in that 10 seconds. Rest for 10 seconds. Repeat 3 times.

**Drill 2: Fast Feet Shuffle**

https://www.youtube.com/embed/UvgZCVcsReA?rel=0

Side View

https://www.youtube.com/embed/hPZq9BbmmVY?rel=0

Standing in your marking base, you’re going to do the fast feet drill, but this time you’ll be shuffling between two cones at about 5 yards (4.5 meters) apart. Your goal is to chop your feet as quickly as you can for 10 seconds as you move from cone to cone, maximizing the number of ground contacts while moving laterally from cone to cone. . Rest for 10 seconds. Repeat 4 times; alternate which direction you start. Do 2 where you start toward the left and 2 where you start toward the right.

**Drill 3: Single Leg Replacement Hops**

https://www.youtube.com/embed/XF6vIAcM2mI?rel=0

Side View

https://www.youtube.com/embed/SEYZ-9TkZe4?rel=0

Standing with one foot on a line, get into your athletic marking base. Shift your weight toward the foot on the line. Hop straight up, and switch which leg is on the line. Your goal is to keep your weight predominantly over the line. This means you will alternate which leg has most of your weight on it. Do 10 hops on each leg, or 20 hops total, pausing for 2-3 seconds in between hops.

##  Drilling The Triangle Mark

**Set-up:**

https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rm99vOpuIuQ?rel=0

Set up your cones accordingly for a forehand orientation.

Using your cones, we’ll practice moving quickly

**Taking Away the Shown Throw → Taking Away the Around Throw (first break)**

https://www.youtube.com/embed/LXVk-nmetaI?rel=0

Practice shuffling from the “Shown Throw” to the “Around throw” by shuffling from the pivot cone to the around break cone. Reset every rep. Complete 5-10 reps.

Go through 5-10 more times where you shuffle from the pivot cone, to the around break cone, and then back to the pivot cone. 5-10 reps.

**Taking Away the Around Throw → Taking Away the Inside Throw (second  break throw)**

https://www.youtube.com/embed/7LRpyYe_N7o?rel=0

Practice shuffling from the “Around Throw” to the “Inside  throw” by shuffling from the around break cone to the inside break cone. Reset every rep. Complete 5-10 reps.

Go through 10 more times where you shuffle from the Around cone, to the Inside cone, and then back to the Around cone. 5-10 reps.

**Taking Away the Inside Throw → Resetting  (back to open side “Shown Throw”)**

https://www.youtube.com/embed/b4SFJ3oGAQs?rel=0

Practice shuffling from the “Inside Throw” to the “Shown  throw” by shuffling from the inside break cone to the pivot cone. Reset every rep. Complete 5-10 reps.

Go through 10 more times where you shuffle from the Around cone, to the Inside cone, and then back to the Around cone. 5-10 reps. (this simulates the thrower resetting, and then immediately trying to pivot into you to draw contact!)

###  Combinations

I like to combine these drills so that I’m going through 2-3 cones in patterns of my choosing. It’s really important that you practice moving in all planes, because with more planes of movement, there are more opportunities for the mark to draw contact and foul the thrower. I typically do these movement patterns on agility-focused workout days!

Try these patterns for 20 seconds on, 20 seconds rest (or more rest if you need it!)

Pivot → Around → Pivot → Inside
Pivot → Inside → Around → Inside → Pivot
Pivot → Around → Inside → Pivot

REPEAT IT ALL WITH A BACKHAND ORIENTATION/SET-UP!

##  Assignment: Post below!

- What movement pattern do you find easiest?
- Where do you feel like you struggle?

**My self evaluation:**
I struggle to reset back to my original position at the pivot area. I find that unless someone is specifically communicating with me from the sideline, I tend to move away from the thrower slowly, until I’m too far away! On the other hand, I’m good at going from the pivot to the around. I feel like especially with my long arms, I get to that position quickly and efficiently.

# week 4 session 2 - Game Footage Examples

Today we're watching film and looking for examples of what you've learned!

This session is about putting what we have learned into practice and working together to create some resources we can share about marking. We all already love ultimate and probably watch a good deal of it online. Our goal here is to notice the things we are practicing and seeing how they are working for others. Obviously, everyone has their own “flavor” to their mark, that’s what makes us individuals! We all don’t look the same on the mark, because we are not the same; our bodies are all different.

Our goal is to see some of those cues in our marking position and movement patterns in action. That way when we’re trying to teach others or study our marks, we have solid examples to draw from. Here are some recent examples that I found from USA Ultimate Club Regionals:

###  Examples from Fury (Blue) vs Nightlock (White) Southwest Regional Finals - 2017:

**#13 Cree Howard on Fury marking #96 Patricia Anderson on Nightlock (left side of screen)**

https://www.youtube.com/embed/r77bZfe43Rc?rel=0&amp;start=439

**Scenario:** Disc is on the open side of the field (left side of screen).

**Notes:** Howard has a pretty tight buffer, but is able to watch the thrower’s vision and body language/grip to see exactly what she is hoping for at exactly each moment. She can proactively vary her arm/hand positions to meet the thrower’s desired throwing lanes.

**#13 Michelle McGhee on Nightlock marking #4 Alex Snyder on Fury**

https://www.youtube.com/embed/r77bZfe43Rc?rel=0&amp;start=428

**Scenario:** Snyder has disc in center of field (looking to attack the inside break with a forehand force).

**Notes:** McGhee moves to get her shoulder on the inside passing lane. Good example of proactively placing hand where the thrower is looking, and forces Snyder to have to throw lower with a different edge once she already committed to the throw.

**Good marking series by 3 Nightlock players**

https://www.youtube.com/embed/r77bZfe43Rc?rel=0&amp;start=458

**Scenario:** Snyder (#4 Fury) picks up disc, mark forces a swing to Howard (#13 Fury), forces another swing to Ruden (#44 Fury).

**#14 Emmy Kolanz Nightlock**

https://www.youtube.com/embed/r77bZfe43Rc?rel=0&amp;start=595

**Scenario:** Nightlock turns disc over deep; Fury intercepts the disc and gets their offense moving.

**Notes:** I like how she approaches on the mark and responds to eye movement of the thrower. I like how you can tell exactly where Sun (#XX) on Fury is looking, she puts her hand there, and can save body movements for when Sun winds up for throws to make them challenging.

###  Examples from Polar Bears (Blue) vs Mischief (Red) Southwest Regional Mixed 2nd Place Game - 2017

**Polar Bears (Blue) vs. Mischief (Red) (Sorry….can’t see the jersey numbers)**

https://www.youtube.com/embed/9blnvdcYN20?rel=0&amp;start=53

**Scenario:** The disc is swinging from middle to break side (top right part of screen).

**Notes:** I would aim to improve the efficiency in this mark’s stance, but I really like how he responds to the thrower’s vision and body language. The thrower was looking toward the reset in the center of the field as he pushed up into the cutting space and the mark read appropriately, placing his hand in a place that limited the thrower’s space to throw.

**#33 Scott Gatto on Mischief (red) marking #18 Nicholas Alexander on Polar Bears**

https://www.youtube.com/embed/9blnvdcYN20?rel=0&amp;start=1010

**Scenario:** Mischief on D off of the pull; #33 is marking the primary handler for Polar Bears

**Notes:** #18 touches the disc a ton for Polar Bears, yet, #33 limits him to limited “easy break” throws. He has a really good marking stance, great distance from the thrower and chops his feet with small steps. #18 gets two break throws off: one early in the possession where his receiver has to lay out and toe the sideline to stay in bounds with an incredible grab, the other, because #33 got a bit lazy and needed to chop his feet 1-2 more steps to the break side.

##  Assignment:

Build a Community Library of Athletic Marks in Game Film

1. Find a game that is free and available on YouTube.
2. Post a link to that game and pick out 2-3 examples like I did above.
   - **Give a quick descriptive title.** It should provide the basic information about who is marking and what team they represent/jersey color. For example: #33 Gatto from Mischief in Red marking #18 Alexander from Polar Bears in Blue.
   - **Provide a link to the time in the video.** We want to see some great examples of marking form in action. We should be able to click the link and see your particular example within 5-10 seconds of where the link begins. (see this post for instructions on exactly how to do this)
   - **Provide a quick scenario.** Identify where they are in the screen and what is happening on the film. For example: Mischief is on defense and pulling to Polar Bears (receiving on the right side of the screen/field).
   - **Give some quick notes about what you see that is working well.**
3. Comment on someone else's video. Do you notice anything else? Does it remind you of something else? Do you really like/dislike what the mark is doing with his/her hands or distance given the scenario?
