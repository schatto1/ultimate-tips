**Basic High Percentage Catching Technique For Every Situation**

Catching is the most important skill in ultimate - if you can't catch reliably, then you don't get the disc in your hands.

Increasing your catching percentages individually has many positive effects on your team, and improving your 'ideal catching technique' is instrumental to this. Avoid falling into bad catching habits by repeating poor technique (such as one-handed catching), which feels more comfortable in the short term due to dominant hand bias but will affect your percentages in the long term.

 

**Six basic catches (3x2):**

1. Clap catch (either hand on top)

2. Crab catch (thumbs up or thumbs down)

3. One-handed catch (either hand)

 

\- Clap catch is most reliable & safest catch

\- Crab catch can get the disc higher/lower and further out in front (good when under pressure)

\- One-hand catch to catch the disc at its furthest extremes

 

Always get two hands to the disc if you are able to.

 

This image provides a guideline for which is the 'ideal' catching technique, depending on where you are able to meet the disc.

Note that clap catching is appropriate in most situations - especially considering you can move your body to get the disc into the clap catching zone.

The image is simplified - assumes the player is balanced and the disc is coming from where the player is facing.

 

**Throwing For High Percentage Catches:**

\- Aim throws at the top of the chest of the receiver as it has the largest margin for error, as it is the mid-point between the top of their jumping reach and the ground.

\- For short-range throws, aim 'at the basket' - as if the receiver had their arms out in front of them forming a hoop and you have to throw through that hoop. This makes clap catching easier.

 

**Homework:**

1. Watch game footage, taking note of the types of catches, & in particular when the disc is dropped.

2. Practice appropriate catching with a partner, referring to the catching areas diagram.





# Catching Technique

**Advanced Clap Catching Technique
**

As soon as the disc is passed to you, **move your feet.** If possible, position yourself so the disc is coming towards your torso. Jump or crouch to get your chest behind the disc & execute a clap catch.

The hand you put on top of the disc when clap catching depends upon the angle, the velocity, and the spin of the disc.

Avoid crossing your arms over, and when the disc is out to the side, one hand should act as a 'back board' for the catch - this creates a kind of 'basket' to make the catch safer.

Train the 'uncomfortable' clap catch by having a partner throw angled discs to you. Take the angle to the extreme to determine which is the 'ideal' catch.

The difference in time between clap catching with one hand or the other on top and then going into a throw, is negligible.

 

**Priorities for a catcher after a disc is thrown to you:**

1. Move your feet to get your body behind the disc

2. Prepare early for a clap catch, and change your plan later if you need to

3. Splay your fingers to get your hands as big as you can

4. Clap the disc with the appropriate hand on top, clapping directly in the centre of the disc, or on the leading edge for faster throws

5. Bend your elbows and bring the disc in towards your body

 

To be the safest, most reliable catcher you can be, train your reflexes to mean you will execute the 'ideal technique' catch without thinking about it. Clap catch when you are throwing casually - in the park, just after putting your boots on, after training.

 

Aim to have both hands contacting the disc at the same time. Practice 'freeze holds' - not changing the angle of the disc during/after the catch.

 

**Homework:**

1. Work out you 'uncomfortable' clap catch.

2. Practice the uncomfortable but 'correct' technique, until it feels more natural.

3. Throw and catch a variety of different velocities & angles, working out which is the 'correct' clap catch technique for each throw.

4. Throw around with two discs at the same time, at short range.

5. Move your feet first, & aim for perfection on all of these catches.



# Spin and Edge

**The video above includes all of the notes below:** 

Thanks to Matty Weintraub for helping me with this module.

 

**How Spin Affects Your Catch**

Whenever a disc is coming towards you, one side of it is spinning towards you, and the other side is spinning away from you. For a right-handed backhand, the right hand side of the disc is spinning towards you, as you look at it.

 

The side that is spinning towards you will want to stick in your hand due to **friction**, the side that is spinning away will want to pull out of your hand. You should aim to **contact the side of the disc that is spinning towards you** when you make a catch, in order to make the catch as safe as possible.

 

For outside-in throws, the **top** edge is spinning towards you. For inside-out throws, the **bottom** edge is spinning towards you. In the case of an overthrow of a lateral pass in a game situation, typical open side throws & 'around' breaks have the **furthest** side spinning towards you, whereas for typical inside-out breaks, it is the side that is **closest** to you that is spinning towards you.

 

Upside-down passes have the **top edge** of the disc spinning towards you, unless they helix, at which point the **bottom edge** is spinning towards you.

 

Getting your **palm** behind the disc for one-handed catches stops the velocity of the pass. Trailing edge passes after often used because of right-hand dominance, however if both hands were equally dexterous then trailing edge is usually the harder catch.

 

**Layouts** - there are pros and cons to landing on your chest or rolling, you should do what comes naturally and what you're comfortable with - however, avoid landing on your side.

 

**Homework:**

\1. Learn which side of the disc is spinning towards you - throw the disc to yourself, throw in pairs with focus on catching the side that is spinning towards you - for the full variety of inside-out / outside-in, overheads, and so on.

\2. Take part in a 'mac line' - 3 or more players in a line, those in the middle must touch the disc without 'killing it' - so that it can still be caught by the player at the end of the line. Contact the other side of the disc here - the side that is spinning away from you - and it will bounce from your hand



# Boxing Out & Catching Versatility

**Boxing Out Your Opponent & Increasing Your Catching Versatility Through Variety Training**

 

**1. Boxing out**

\- position your body between the defender and where the disc is going to be catchable

\- use two hands to be harder to get around

\- choose the right moment to attack the disc - the balance of boxing out to start, and going for the catch at the end

\- 'seal off' your defender

 

**2. Variety training**

\- perfect practice makes perfect, use ideal technique 9/10ths of the time when throwing casually

\- 1/10th of your training time should be dedicated to non-ideal/strange technique catches, to give you a better feel for the disc

\- wrong-way-round clap catches

\- trailing edge catches

\- freeze catches

\- silent / loud catches

\- quick reaction-test catches

\- experimental catches - have fun with experimentation!

 

**3. Laying out** - turn the disc over before you land, if landing on your chest

 

**4. Rim catch** - at very highest extreme

 

**5. Hammer crowd catch trick** - when in a crowd, consider 'mac'ing the disc up to make the second bid catch easy

 

**6. Clap catch upside-down passes** if you have space and time

 

**7. Anti-face-marking catching** - fake the catch to deceive the marker, like you would fake a throw to move the force

 

**Homework:**

1. Boxing out training - have your partner throw discs which drop down out of the sky, and position yourself so that they are coming down on a pre-defined side of your body - imagine the defence is coming from left/right/infront/behind and reposition to get them on your back

2. Variety training - spend 1/10th of your throw around time practicing catching in ways which are definitely not 'ideal technique', including:

\- trailing edge catches

\- wrong-way-round clap catches (both ways)

\- freeze catches

\- silent / loud catches

\- quick reaction-test catches

\- spin-around catches

\- self-mac catches (such as the hammer crowd catch trick)

3. Next time you are face-marked, try to convince your marker that the disc is in the air and get them to take their eye off you
