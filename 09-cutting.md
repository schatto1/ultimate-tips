# Week 1- Fundamentals of Cutting
## The Goal of Good Cutting
When we are cutting, what are we trying to accomplish? Are we trying to score? To get the disc? To beat our defender or the defense? It’s obviously not as simple of a question as it seems on the surface. We’ll take one of each, please!

But what I want to focus on is getting separation. This is the basic idea at the center of what we are doing as cutters. If we get separation, we beat the defense. To get the disc effectively, we need to create separation for our thrower to hit us in. If we want to score, we’ll have to getting separation in the end zone. Ultimately, if we are getting separation, attacking the right spaces, and timing it all correctly, we are going to be a very effective cutter.

Here, we see a cutter get separation o the break side. Because the mark is so far away, the cutter has the opportunity to put up a break side huck. Throwers are often most dangerous in the first two seconds after they catch the disc. If the cutter’s catch is contested, they won’t have the space from the mark to make a quality throw.

Here, the handler gets separation, allowing them to make a yardage-gaining break throw! That’s about as valuable as it gets! Look at how far the mark gets away from the handler. Think of how many options that handler has a thrower: break side, huck, give and go, etc.

## The Three Variables
There’s three variables we can manipulate when we’re cutting: our speed, our direction, and our position. When we accelerate, we change our speed. When we plant hard and push the other way, we change direction. When we go from open side to break side, we change position, specifically field position. When we get between our defender and the space the thrower is targeting, we change our body position. And in varying combinations, we can create an nearly infinite number of ways to get separation.

For the most part, we are going to focus here on speed and direction. Position is very contextual, in particular field position. It can be hard to practice and gets reps with. It’s hard to build away from the field. But speed and change of direction? We’ll talk some about body position, but mostly focus on those.

## Homework
For homework, we have a partner drill, and one of my favorites: Five Cone Cutting Drill.

![five cone cutting drill](images/five-cone-cutting-drill.png)

The setup above shows nine cones, arranged in two rows. The Offense cones are further apart and have a middle cone. You can play with these distances however you’d like, but you want your far cones 14 yards from the middle and the short cones 4 yards from the middle. The Defense cones are 11 and 3 yards from the middle; you can adjust these as you see fit.

Have your cutter start on the middle cone, marked as white above, and the defender directly across from them, a buffer between them in line with how you coach defenders. The Offense begins by running to one of the short cones. The defense tries to beat the offense to their corresponding short cone. The Offense then runs to their opposite short cone, and again, the defense tries to beat them to their corresponding cone. The Offense then must return to the middle cone.

At this point, the objective is for the offense to reach one of their far cones before the defense can reach the corresponding far cone. This represents getting open deep or under. Again, to reinforce it, the defense’s objective on every change of direction is to beat the offense to the corresponding defensive cone, not beat the offender in general. The reason we focus on this is because, as you recall from the beginning, our goal is getting separation! And this drill focuses specifically on changing speed and direction (since you can’t leave the row of cones) to create separation.

Go through this drill with a partner or group of people and get everyone at least 8 reps.



Once you get it down, you have flexibility to adjust distances, remove the short defensive cones, or add restrictions to how many changes of direction a cutter can make or an amount of time to be counted out loud that the cutter has before they have to commit.

# Week 2 - The Cutting Families
In our last session, we looked at three variables we can manipulate as cutters: speed, direction, and positioning. Cuts are combinations of manipulating these elements.

We can divide cuts into three major families: Commitment, Explosion, and Shoulder. Most cuts are either in one of these families, blended together, or are really multiple separate cuts in succession. Commitment cuts rely on a change of direction, typically when your defender has committed to one direction and you change to a different one. Explosion cuts rely on a change of speed. They are often most effective when they timed correctly, either within the flow of the offense, based on the behavior of the defense, or both. Shoulder cuts combine a change of position, getting you to a favorable position and putting your defender in a weaker position.

## Explosion

There happens to have been a very timely article on Ultiworld (note: only fully available to paid subscribers to Ultiworld) entitled “Notes From a Contrarian Coach: Great Cutters Don’t Fake” and it describes, more or less, how effective many cutters are at simply changing speeds at the right time using explosion cuts. Most cuts are explosion cuts. Simply accelerating in one direction is often enough to extend an existing advantage on your defender and get you the separation you need to be successful.

Watch the cutter at the back of the stack. He sees the defender is not looking, the ideal time to make an explosion cut, and accelerates away. Nothing tricky, just timing and speed.

When should we use this cut? Conceptually, when you already have an advantage you want to press. Is your defender not between you and a space you’re threatening, like the deep space? You can explode to extend your advantage. Is your defender not looking at you? Has the disc position changed which spaces you can threaten, like after a swing to the break side? Are you simply faster than you defender? These are all advantages we can build on with explosion cuts.

## Commitment

The cutter at the front of the stack drives hard towards the right side of the field. As soon as the defender commits to that direction, the cutter changes. Look at their hips! The cutter’s hips are not committed to that direction, but the defender’s hips are facing the right side of the field. The cutter dictated the situation. The idea here is to force your defender to commit to a direction and then change direction.

The cutter on the far side of the field turns and drives out with a few hard steps. It forces the defender to commit. When the cutter changes direction, again, look at which way the defender’s hips are facing. They are facing out while the cutter is going in. The defender’s body is committed to out.

## Shoulder

Between Explosion and Commitment cuts, so to speak, are shoulder cuts. They involve a change of direction, like commitment cuts, but are shorter and rely on you to read what the defense gives you more than a commitment cut. By attacking a defender’s shoulders, you can force them to twist their shoulders (and more important, hips!), and that opens up space for you to change direction. A jab step or a few forward steps might be all it takes to create this commitment.

Perhaps we should call this the Shofner Cut because Jesse Shofner has it mastered. Her quickness and decisiveness are elite, and you see how quickly she reads her defenders’ commitment to decide where to attack after her initial jab step.

Look at the cutter in the top right part of the screen, Alissa Soo. While her initial move is strong, the defender does an excellent job recovering. Soo changes direction again as a reaction, and while she gets open, the timing is no longer right to get the disc. But the technique of her cut is on display.

## Homework
For homework, consider the following questions:

What variable of cutting are you most effective at manipulating? Which family of cut are you the best at?
What variable to you utilize the most? Which family do you use the most?
Bonus: If you have a playing opportunity between this week’s module and next, try to use a cut from each family over the course of play, even if it’s uncomfortable. Push yourself past your habits and out of your comfort zone!
