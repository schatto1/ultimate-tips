# Finding Your Digital Mentor (Lauren Boyle)

# Week 1: Choose Your Mentor

## **What is a Digital Mentor?**

The growth of our sport has given way to a surplus of footage to see elite players in action.  It can be intimidating to know where to start or how to use footage. That is what I am here for. I will help you on your way for dissecting top players skills and discovering ways to practice and apply skills to your game.

We were not all built physically and mentally equal. Every ultimate athlete has a different body type, speed, explosiveness, set of throws, approach to attacking space on the field, etc. I guarantee there is a player at the elite level that is built and has strengths like yours. Watching film of that player is a great tool to your own self discover and evolution as an ultimate athlete. They become your digital mentor.  

For instance, one of my athletes, Kate, struggled with her deep defense during 1v1 huck drills. After one practice, Kate approached me and said, “Lauren, how do I get better at this? I’m tired of getting skyed all the time. It’s not fun.” My usual coaching method for boxing out wasn’t working for Kate. Kate’s strength is speed. At 5’1, she was having trouble capitalizing on that speed to overcome her lack of height. I did not know how to give Kate an adjustment; I did know of a short and zippy elite player who dominated the field, Laura Bitterman. A digital mentor was born. Kate watched film to see how Bit initially set up on D, altered her position as her opponent was in motion, and ultimately, how did she use her strength of speed to overcome her lack of height to win the disc in the air.

##  Where to Start?

Pick someone whose skill set is achievable within your given talents. Not everyone can be 6’5” or incredibly fast. We all have strengths. The quickest growth happens when we know our own strengths and add to them. Finding someone relatable to you will be that catalyst for your growth. For simplicity sake, we will divide people into short, average, tall for body type and speedy verse explosive for a strength of movement.  

If you have someone in mind, start with that person. There is a reason you are drawn to them. If you have a couple it is fine, we can use a different person for different activities. Skip ahead to the assignment section.

For those of you that do not have anyone in mind, here are the finals from last year’s USA Ultimate National Championships. It is great places to start for each division as all of these teams have a wide variety of players to pick from.

# Throwing Shape and Weight Distribution

**Introduction**

This week we are going to watch our Digital Mentor while they have the disc in their hands. You can learn throwing techniques from any player regardless of body type and strength. Where a digital mentor helps you excel is seeing how they use attributes  similar to yours as a weapon. How do they use their lankiness or agility or smarts to distribute the disc to different spaces? We are going to focus our film analysis in 2 steps, our mentor’s body position at release and how they beat their mark with that throw.  

I like watching my digital mentors to learn new break throws. There are a multitude of ways to get a disc a certain spot on the field. Breaking down how your digital mentor is able to achieve that through their body positioning and how make their mark off balance or out of position will add versatility to be dangerous with the disc in your hand.  

If you are looking to watch basic forehand and backhand fundamentals, you can use [Ultiworld’s “Throwing Form Project](https://ultiworld.com/2017/03/24/throwing-form-project-video-archive-elite-throwers-mechanics/).”  (Note from Melissa: our next module in the Skills Development Lab is going to be focused in more detail on throwing mechanics for power!) They did a great job showing body positioning from different angles. These basics are not specific to body type and strengths but solid fundamentals is never a bad thing to improve on.  

**Body Position at Release**

We are going to examine our digital mentor’s stance at the point the disc is released and break it down from toes to the tips of their fingers.  I like starting with body positioning first. If we can recreate the shape of their body, then we can find different ways to set up that body shape with quick releases, fakes, shimmies, etc. But first we need to be able to recreate the shape with balance and control.

To be able to throw a specific throw consistently well, it is important to be balanced within your stance. An off-balance throw creates a situation where you are not in complete control of your body creating a potential wild throw. It is good to practice that as you will probably need to throw off balance sometimes but for this case, let’s focus on what we will do 80% of the time.

Examine the body shape of your mentor. To do this, I like to slow the youtube video down to a quarter speed. I can find the exact moment and pause to see that shape. Then I start at their base for how they find balance in their feet and move up through their body all the way to how the edges of the disc. Here are some questions to get you thinking.  How are their feet positioned? How is their weight distributed? How far are they leaning with their torso? What is the extension of their arm to break through or around their mark? What edge are they putting on the disc?

Recreate this shape in front of a mirror to get check if you can match your mentors shape. Remember how this shape feels and go out and imitate while throwing from this stance. Fight for balance.  

A note on distribution of weight: Our pivot foot is used for balance, and to not travel, and the non-pivot foot has a majority of our weight. With the weight in the non-pivot foot it is easier to lean our torso onto the side that we are throwing on to get extra inches around our mark. (See the video at the top) As you can see, we can cheat length by shifting our weight onto our non-pivot foot.  

**Beating the Mark**

Now that you have the stance established, let’s talk about using it to beat the mark. The battle between offense and defense lies in who can stay athletic and balanced during the match-up. How does your digital mentor set-up the throw to make the mark off-balance?  Off-balance could mean the mark opens up a throwing window by committing too hard to one side or they break form from their natural marking stance. A thrower can create these opportunities with quick release, pairing it with another throw, a big fake, and/or a creative throw.

**Example of a quick release:** In USA Ultimate 2016 National Women’s final, Alyssa Weatherford #25 at 32:23 uses a quick release to get off an Inside Out (IO) flick to the break side. It is too quick for her mark to adjust and a low release where the mark’s hand would not naturally be positioned. You can see the mark has collapsed trying to defend the throw. You can see it again in slow motion at the end of the play. Look at the mark’s positioning it has collapsed making her off-balanced.

**Example of pairing throws:** In USA Ultimate 2016 National Men’s Final, in the first point of the game, #28 on Revolver Nathan White was able to gain yards with his throws to the break side of the field utilizing his strength, length, in two different ways. At 7:23, he throws an around flick. At 7:37, he throws an inside backhand. His body positioning, even at max extension, is balanced and controlled. The first throw causes the mark to shift over for the second. This pairing makes him a bigger threat with the disc as he is able to get the disc to the break side in a variety of ways. One helps the other as the mark cannot cover both.

### Assignment

Elite players have their go-to throw. The break they know they can get off 80% of the time. That throw becomes more dangerous when it is paired with another strong throw that hits a different window of the mark. Use your digital mentor to either establish a favorite break throw if you do not have one, or pick up a new throw from them to pair it so you become even more dangerous with the disc in your hands.

1. Pick a throw that you want in your arsenal
2. Stand in front of the mirror to mimic the stance.
3. What did they do prior to the throw? Did they move their mark? How? Or did they use quick release?
4. Go out and practice.
   1. Start with the stick figure shape you practiced and find a way to be balanced in that stance. Throw from that position.
   2. Add the movement they did prior to that shape. Can you find balance? Does the disc fly how you want it to?
   3. Add a mark. It is ok if you only have one person to throw with. A fence makes a fine target. 

**To Complete your assignment**, post in the comments:

\1. Whos throw are you trying to learn from and imitate? (with a link to an example would be best!)

\2. A picture of yourself mimicking the stance you're trying to create or even better, a link to a video clip of yourself attempting the throw. **It does not matter if you can't do it yet!** This is why we're practicing! A video clip will help Lauren and others to give you feedback and accelerate your learning.



# Creating an off-balanced defender

### **Introduction**

Regardless of the type of offense, the general idea is to progress the disc down the field. When the offense meets an obstruction, good defense, the offense goes laterally to find a different route and then continues to progress. That is essentially the game. It sounds simple and great offenders make it look that easy by making the field “bigger”. A good defender will take away the primary space an offender wants to attack; a good offender will find ways to make the defender off-balance to take the space anyway or create a powerful secondary option by opening up other throwing windows. Watching techniques your digital mentor uses to open the field on top of their talents such as height or speed is what can take your game from good to great.


There are many techniques to break down a defenders balance: varying speed, shimmy, jab step, attacking a different hip, etc. There are also a variety of ways to open up throwing windows: starting a cut in the triple threat position, taking what is given, the angles of cuts, etc. Now is the fun part. Let’s use video of our digital mentor to see how they create these opportunities by breaking down their moves from film and sharing them here. My goal is to not break down every technique but rather teach how to evaluate film. Tip: Once you find an instance of a technique you want to learn, slowing down the video to a quarter speed is a useful trick to breaking down movement.

###  **Creating an off-balanced defender**


Let’s focus on person defense. As I said in Week 2, the battle between offense and defense lies in who can stay athletic and balanced during the match-up. As the offender you have a great advantage; you are controlling your movement and the defender is reacting to you.

There are numerous ways to “put someone on their heels” or make someone off-balance. See the video above for explanation of what on-balance verse off-balanced means. 


In my example below I use Claire Chastain for techniques she uses to make her defender off-balance. Everyone knows she wants to get the disc upline. Even though her defense tries to limit her, she still find ways to take that space. Watching video we can see the techniques she uses.  

###  Example Offender - Claire Chastain attacking upline:

**Technique 1 - The shimmy**

In this video, if she continues to run her route it will be a tight window for the thrower. To open up space for the throw, she alters her speed and gives a quick shoulder fake. The defender reacts by shifting their weight and  overcommitting in the opposite direction leaving them off-balance and unable to recover. Upline success!

**Technique 2 - Attacking the other hip**

A way Claire creates opportunities is by putting her defender on their heels by attacking the other hip. When she sees that her defender is defending the upline, she then attacks their other hip causing her defender to be off-balance. She then continues to move upline. To add this to your own play, see how much space she gives to the disc initially to give room for the juke. Other note, this technique works when her defender is playing very tight as there is not time for the defender to recover footwork and therefore loses their center of balance.

###  Assignment

\1. Find two examples of how your digital mentor gets the defense off balance. If your digital mentor is primarily a defensive player, find two examples of how they stay on balance for shutdown defense. Watch their footwork and body position.
\2. Tell us how you plan to implement what you see at your next practice, pod, league, pick-up, game, etc.

Put your homework in the comments below!

**Coming up next week!** We'll explore cutting angles and how to be dangerous in more spaces using Joel Schlachet as an example.



# Creating Offensive Space

Great offenders will find ways to make the field bigger through the way they move. This can be done is a variety of ways but there are some basics I will discuss here.


Angles - WIthout getting into the specifics of which angles are stronger in different spaces on the field, ho stack or vert stack, a general principle I like to teach is this. Imagine the entire field is a piece of grid paper. Never cut along one of those lines because you are only giving yourself one plane of direction to move which is easier to defend and harder to throw to. Watch your digital mentor for how they use angles to create throwing windows on the field.


Multiple threat position - A multiple threat position is a location where you are dangerous attacking more than one space. For example, a cutter can threaten 3 spaces (open, break and deep) by being about 5 yds to the break side and 10-15 yds downfield of the disc. This is shallow enough for a huck and also deep enough to gain an in while being viable for an initial quick break throw. This make the defender choose one to deny leaving options for the cutter.  See how your digital mentor initially positions or moves into a multiple threat positions on the field to create opportunity.


Example Offender - Joel Schlachet #4 scoring a lot of goals.

Technique 1 - Take what is given.

At where I started the video at 10:12, Joel is in the middle of the field as his teammates are working down the open side. He is pushing downfield to set up a continue cut. At 10:16 his defender completely loses sight of him and faces up the disc. This is when Joel takes advantage by attacking the break side deep. He took what was given that was also a viable option for his thrower. Goal.  

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j9G5mPOk8YE?start=612" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" style="box-sizing: border-box; position: absolute; top: 0px; bottom: 0px; left: 0px; width: 640px; height: 360px; border: 0px; background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"></iframe>



Technique 2 - Make your clear a viable cut

Joel Schlachet bursts upline and is not hit. He then turns his clear into a viable cut by making a sharp angle away and keeping eyes on the disc. This is an important skill that Joel uses. He is constantly ready to catch for his thrower and makes sharp angles so that his teammates can throw to space. This is how he utilizes his speed over height to be a bigger target.
