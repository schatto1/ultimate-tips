# Handler Offense and Defense (Ben Wiggins)

# week 1 - Handler Defense

Let’s put in some focused, fundamental-based work into being a better and more adaptable handler-defender.


Ultimate is a creative sport, but not creative like ‘write a flowery poem’ or ‘perform in an improv show’. This is creative like ‘how do I build a livable structure out of the materials I can find in the forest’. The artistry is less about magnificent self expression (and hammers) and more about honing the tools that you have to do the best job that you can. This is a proletariat kind of creativity, and it means thinking about the very smallest pieces of the game.

## Handler Defense

I’m going to describe a set of defensive drills today in which you will not chase a player or lay out for a huge block. Instead, I want to get you ready for those more exciting plays by simply lining up correctly. The majority times a player loses a matchup race, it is because they weren’t lined up correctly at the start. Imagine if 7 of the 10 finalists in the 100-meter dash were facing sideways or behind the line or standing up straight! If you consistently get yourself lined up in the flow of the game, you create defensive pressure, traps to confuse the offense and (as a small minority of successful defensive plays) get the blocks yourself. So let’s line up correctly…even if that small piece is relatively boring by itself!


For each of these drills, you’ll get the biggest benefit from doing the drill for 4-5 reps on 3 days in the span of a few weeks. They help to build neural pathways that will guide your body while you are trying to use the rest of your brain to understand how 13 other players (and an important piece of plastic) are moving around you. You’ll progress quickly into feeling like these drills are too simple, which is a good thing. After 2-3 short focused sessions you should only need to check back in with a drill for a reminder rep or two when you find yourself struggling with a particular move.


Practice lining up with a reset handler with a partner. Throw a disc down on a field as a marker for where the thrower would be. Then decide on the direction of the field and the force. Based on this information, your partner (played in the following video by the excellent Ryan Segal, in white) should find an attack point. If the disc is near the forced sideline, this position is lateral with the disc. Have the reset handler physically point the direction in which they want to cut upline for the easiest yardage-gaining pass. That outstretched full arm helps to visualize, so don’t skimp and do it even if it feels a bit silly. Stand a few feet away, then for each rep hustle to position so that you are underneath their arm. By putting your body on the line of the best cut, you will force them to go in some sub-optimal direction. Real ultimate is not so controlled, and you’ll never line up exactly perfectly, but the closer and more often you get to this line the better.



<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0usjhnjp7gY?rel=0" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" style="box-sizing: border-box; position: absolute; top: 0px; bottom: 0px; left: 0px; width: 640px; height: 360px; border: 0px; background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"></iframe>




To recap: In the video above we work from a 45-degree position. This is a common position in the middle of the field or when the disc is being forced towards the reset handler. The partner is physically pointing in the direction of the best, easiest cut. Move a few steps and get lined up! This kind of pattern formation helps you to be automatic later when it counts.


To increase the difficulty, move around your partner for 2-5 seconds and have them randomly start the rep so that you come at it from different footworks. Don’t just practice the easiest footwork; learn to be a creative recoverer of position!


For defenders of talented handlers, we know that the offense will sometimes catch the disc moving upfield. Dishy passes after upfield throws are impossible to prevent completely, but we want to strike the right balance between turnover-inducing pressure and limiting open upfield cuts. So let’s prepare to make the best of a bad situation by using an ‘antidote’ marking drill. Here, the offense is self-throwing to simulate a short pass from which they can look downfield. The defense is scrambling to quickly recover position and then get the first second or two of the mark. This is not about feeling a burn in your quads, but it is about hustling without overcommitting. You want to stop the first, longest and most breakside throws without fouling. Since there is no ‘win’ here, only losses of lesser magnitude, you’ll feel the pressure and it will tend to push you to unbalanced rushing past the thrower. Move quickly and with balance while you avoid contact on your way to the right marking position.



<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2-lI36aJJhM?rel=0" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" style="box-sizing: border-box; position: absolute; top: 0px; bottom: 0px; left: 0px; width: 640px; height: 360px; border: 0px; background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"></iframe>




If that gets too easy, you’ll see how we use a random direction to force the D to react without knowing their pathway in advance.


If you can stop the first throws, then you have a chance to get the mark on and impact the offense. Marking drill variations like no hands, not allowing a particular throw, focusing on low or high throws, etc are great too. A quick variation to add for a few reps is to move between the different amounts of block-ed-ness on any particular disc.


In the following video, the defense moves between three different hand positions on the same mark. In the first position, the hand is really only blocking a throw to the break side. The mark is more likely to recover on a pivot around, but is putting less pressure on upfield throws. Moving into the second position allows the possibility of touching the disc even straight upfield. Finally, a third position covers the disc and trades less protection on pivoting throws for really forcing the thrower to pivot and commit their balance (and likely reduce their throwing power and accuracy). Moving between these three positions helps the marker to see the marking angle as dynamic throughout a single stall count and also the kinds of small creativities that you might use within the context of a larger, more simplified force scheme.



<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/duck7rI5uF4?rel=0" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" style="box-sizing: border-box; position: absolute; top: 0px; bottom: 0px; left: 0px; width: 640px; height: 360px; border: 0px; background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"></iframe>




Here is a marking game to work on making the offense react to the D (and not the other way around). For each mark, the offense is trying to break the mark to a target as usual. The thrower wins if they hit the target (for intermediate players this would be a catch by a running player, and for experts this would be a well timed reception by a guarded player that doesn’t require a layout or jump).


The twist here is that the thrower can only cross the disc over the midline of their body a single time in the rep. They’ll try as many moves as possible to throw a forehand, and then only have a single bullet in their pivot chamber to spend. This allows the marker to focus on really covering one throw and then being ready for the one big move.


Offense wins if they break without a pivot. It’s a tie if the successful throw requires a pivot. Any turnover or two pivots is a win for the defense.  This game forces throwers to make large pivots that are more game-like. And it avoids the ten pivot marathons of other marking drills which aren’t as useful in developing first twitch reactions. If you have only ten minutes per week to think about marking, this drill would be the one most worthwhile for building real game marks.



<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/318186B-wKs" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" style="box-sizing: border-box; position: absolute; top: 0px; bottom: 0px; left: 0px; width: 640px; height: 360px; border: 0px; background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"></iframe>




Hopefully you have a lot more than ten minutes for marking! A few reps of varying the distance throughout a single stall count would also be valuable. Moving in to pressure big throws (or pressure throwers that turn their backs) can be useful, but it requires in-out movement. You need to be able to get closer without overdoing it, and you need to be able to dynamically back off to avoid fouling. Besides being poor Spirit to foul, it allows good handlers to throw through fouls and insure their risky decisions. Jumping back can help raise pressure and then keep it. Larger distance between the torsos can also help smaller, quicker markers to stymie the throws of longer, slower throwers. Keeping balance is crucial here.



<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lWolZeivwiA?rel=0" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" style="box-sizing: border-box; position: absolute; top: 0px; bottom: 0px; left: 0px; width: 640px; height: 360px; border: 0px; background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"></iframe>




Lastly, I want to show two variations of a drill for what to do in the split second after a throw. You can do this to the break side or even to the reset, though I am showing this here only to the live side. As the disc is released, practice reacting by sliding a few steps towards the disc. This avoids giving the thrower momentum towards a give-go move, and it puts you more in the path of the likely next thrower’s vision which can help in the overall goal of raising their heart rate with the disc. If you had to make this move only through your conscious mind you would forget often and be far too slow even when you did remember. Instead, drill this into subconscious habit. Slide those two steps on every throw to get you ready for the next move, whether that be a poach or a recovery movement or a lining-up to start the cycle over again.



<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8iPIF_95Lys?rel=0" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" style="box-sizing: border-box; position: absolute; top: 0px; bottom: 0px; left: 0px; width: 640px; height: 360px; border: 0px; background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"></iframe>



 

The second version of this drill includes a snap-look over the shoulder. This can be even quicker in a game. The goal is not to consciously derive a picture of where other players are, but rather to let your reptile brain scan the field. As your head moves back to find the disc and your player, you will subconsciously make small adjustments and reactions to the play behind you. This is even more crucial in zone defense, where the same move helps you to decide on a throw-to-thrower basis whether you should slide 4 yards or 6 (with the difference being the decider between an open popper behind the cup or a completely covered one).



<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ImpWJzZhuo0?rel=0" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" style="box-sizing: border-box; position: absolute; top: 0px; bottom: 0px; left: 0px; width: 640px; height: 360px; border: 0px; background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"></iframe>




That’s a set of 10-12 small drill-lets that you can use to build some of the small-scale skills. As those foot-and-brainworks begin to percolate, they’ll become better and better tools for you to build your defensive masterpiece. You know, the one that leads to a flustered handler cut and then ends with a huge layout block 40 yards away by some highlight reel player who may or may not ever realize that you did all the work for them. When the kids say they are all about the dubs, this kind of creativity is what they should mean!

## Submit Your Homework!

We’d love to hear which of these drills were challenging, which were new, and even see you in action. Comment on this page and I will read and respond to as many as possible. If you have short youtube clips of yourself doing these drills, I will happily provide feedback if that is useful to you.



# week 2 - Handler Offense

We’re working on fundamentals that allow handlers to get open in a variety of scenarios with a variety of footwork options. 

This week's work is divided into two sessions, though you could complete both at one time.

 

## Session 1

### Concept: Setting up for multiple options

Have a partner with a disc and an imaginary field/mark scenario

Set up on the breakside of the disc, level with the thrower, roughly 8 meters away.

From here, the offense can attack upline or back behind the disc. Going upline gains yards and throwing momentum. Going backwards allows a thrower to avoid needing to break the mark. When receiving the disc after going backwards, you should have a continuation angle to the breakside.

####  Drill 1: Finding the position or attack quickly

The purpose of this drill is to practice getting to the most dangerous cutting position quickly.



<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jHQvkTzZKEg?rel=0" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" style="box-sizing: border-box; position: absolute; top: 0px; bottom: 0px; left: 0px; width: 640px; height: 360px; border: 0px; background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"></iframe>



- Start with imagining force backhand scenario
- Set up in a space where you can point out angles to both cuts (upline and backwards)
- Vary the difficulty by having your partner move to new locations and telling you when to set up.

####  Drill 2: Attacking on the move

Cutting from a stationary position can work if you are quick or against weak defense. In other scenarios you’ll be better served by a “flying attack point.



<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ghHqVRANuso?rel=0" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" style="box-sizing: border-box; position: absolute; top: 0px; bottom: 0px; left: 0px; width: 640px; height: 360px; border: 0px; background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"></iframe>



- Mark your ideal attack point with a physical marker
- Do several repetitions of up the line and backwards cuts with a moving approach to your attack point.

####  Drill 3: Resetting yourself to your attack point

Inevitably, even good players sometimes end up in front of their attack point or get to it too early. Learn to react out of that difficult position with a set of backwards steps.



<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PBdrs5rmwAI?rel=0" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" style="box-sizing: border-box; position: absolute; top: 0px; bottom: 0px; left: 0px; width: 640px; height: 360px; border: 0px; background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"></iframe>



- Set up in front of your attack point
- Quickly move backwards to your attack point
- Stay balanced with your eyes on the thrower (in a game they might throw any time!)
- When you get behind your attack point, make a cut up line or backwards as in Drill 2.

 

### Progressions

These same drills can be performed with a forehand force. Perform some repetitions imagining being in the center of the field as well as near the sideline. Every scenario will have a slightly different space and feel. Vary your practice rep over a few weeks for best results.

 

## Session 2

### Concept: Five Types of Cuts

 When you need to loosen the grip of a defender (especially in a more stationary position), there are five basic ways to get open. These five ways apply beyond handlers to all cuts, but we’ll show them here. The five basic ways to get open are (shown in the next video):

**Rush** 

Simply pick a line and run fast. Works great if you are physically superior to your opponent, with the added advantage of simplicity. This is the easiest cut for the thrower and for other defenders to read.

**Jab**

Try to cause a reaction in the defender such that they think you are going in a different direction. Here the cutter shows two jabs, each helping to move the hapless defender off of the best cut path and in some other starting direction which will impede their ability to beat you to the spot. This allows a quick fake and is very versatile, but defenders who are patient and focused can simply wait out the fake and run with the slightly less balanced cutter.

**Drive**

The cutter drives enough steps to get the defender to actually turn their hips into the start of a sprint. This takes more commitment and distance to enact, but more defenders will react to the perceived danger in potentially letting their player run free in that initial direction.

**Wait**

All defenders have to be dynamically seeing the field. This means that they all must (at some point) turn their head to look at something else. When they do, handlers with good awareness can make their move. This leaves something to the decision of the defender, but can have the advantage of a cleaner break and more separation with a disoriented defender. Here the offense shows Wait cuts from two different defensive head turns.

**Seal**

Defenders are constantly repositioning, but some subtle moves are less likely to arouse suspicion. Handlers can often create an advantage by relatively slowly placing their body mass in between the defender and the direction in which they want to cut. They’ll have both the advantage of a shorter path and the having forced the defender to move without running into their churning cleats.

#### Drill 4: Practice and Play with Five Types of Cuts



<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IyJ1AjHqky8?rel=0" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" style="box-sizing: border-box; position: absolute; top: 0px; bottom: 0px; left: 0px; width: 640px; height: 360px; border: 0px; background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"></iframe>



 

## Your Homework

**Make the five cuts above** from the same starting point to the same target (film yourself if you like). In the comments, tell us which cutting pattern feels most natural? Which feels least natural?

### Extra Credit

**For next practice or pickup:** Get a piece of paper and build a small grid. Put columns for 2-4 different cuts that you'll make, and then rows for each of the five moves. Try to fill out the entire grid in an hour of playing. In the comments tell us which cuts you found most difficult to fill in and why.



# week 3 - Transitions

While we spend most of our time thinking about what we want to do on offense or defense, it is the transition time between possessions that can decide games. Handlers have a number of roles to play in transitions, and your efforts to help your team in those situations can have more impact on the final score than by huge amounts of training on either O or D alone.

 

## Homework Part 1:

Watch some game footage paying special attention to the moments after a turnover. Things you should note are:

a. Who is talking?

b. How much time did they have?

c. How much time did it take to transmit information?

d. Were they organized when the disc came in?

 

## Homework Part 2:

For next time you're in a low pressure playing situation (practice, pickup, or low level tournament).

See an option and want to fast-break? Go for it…but be ready to stop that motion up until the point you touch the disc. You can always back away. While you can’t stand over the disc and survey the field, you can walk away from the disc as you make the decision at any point not to pick it up. This is the part that most young handlers have the most difficult time with: using as much of your time as you need. Take that 10 (or 20, or more!) seconds of pre-stall and use what you need to get exactly what you want. Too often, handlers feel a kind of gravity towards picking up the disc and can’t feel the rest of their team begging for a few more seconds.

 

Next practice, game, or pickup try this five step process on a turnover.


\1. Breathe!

\2. Find obvious mismatches that you might use to call a play.

\3. Call for a start to your offense. In a perfect world, you have a player making a first cut ~1 second before you pick up the disc to give you maximum time to see their cut and find defensive rotations. They can only do this if you tell them the play well in advance. It is usual for a cutter to need 4-5 seconds after the play call is repeated 2-3 times to understand their role…that adds up to almost the entire pre-stall. If you aren’t calling the play until you are ready to throw, then you are nearly sure to have no good cut before you need to look for a safety-valve throw.

\4. See the entire field. Take the moment to look all the way around you. You may find wide players you didn’t expect near the sidelines, or a help defender deep that you need to avoid.

\5. Reposition players to get the formation you want.

\6. Breathe again. Then play.

 

The motions of walking to a disc, approaching slowly, calling a play and then starting the possession will happen in the most confusing moment of the game…practice them! 2-3 solitary run-throughs per week will only take you a minute, total, and can help to make these motions routine and subconscious. Did you find yourself taking all of your time, or remembering to call a play as early as possible?

# week 4 - Throwing

By this point in the handling set of skill development posts, you’re like to already have some major clues about how we want handlers to physically throw the disc. We want handlers to be **adaptive** and responsive to their surrounding, we want them to be able to throw **quickly** (both after the catch and after realizing that a player is open) and we want them to be able to throw **calmly regardless of the problem** posed by the defense. Here are some homework assignments for each of those three qualities.

## Homework #1: Adaptive throws

Play in a scrimmage of some kind (pickup, practice, etc). After each point, jot down your throws.

As a way to gauge your own flexibility, note for each throw:

a) Was it completed?

b) Was it the right throw choice?

Look for patterns. If you see turnovers on a specific throw type that you throw more often, you may be trying to make your most comfortable throws work in all situations. If you see completed throws but only on a few throw types, you may be missing opportunities because you stick to a few choices. If you see a range of turnovers across throws, then you may have the vision/understanding you want but need more non-practice throwing explicitly on throws you want to use more in games.

## Homework #2: Quick throws

### Part 1

With discs and a stationary target, throw 20 times at a distance where you can hit the target at least half the time (but unlikely to hit it every time).

Then, from roughly the same distance, throw another 20 discs after catching a self throw that goes at least 1 foot above your head.

Throw each as quickly as you can, and with whichever throw loads most quickly from the catch (example: catches on the left side of the body are likely to load (righthanded) backhands more quickly). Your goal is to hit 70% as many at full quickness as you would at leisure.

### Part 2

**A.** Partner throwing.

Have your partner wait between 1-4 seconds then give you a hand target extended from their body. Throw as quickly as possible to that target with whichever throw is easiest.

**B.** Ramp this up by having the partner call out a specific throw (IO forehand) while giving a randomly-chosen hand target.

**C.** Combine this with self-catches or even catches on the throw from your partner.

For all versions, give yourself 1 point for all catches, 3 points for catches that hit the hand target, and -1 point for all misses. Your goal is 15 points out of ten throws.

## Homework #3: Calm throws

You’ll need:

- A square of space ~10x10 yards as a target
- 2-3 objects as obstacles (these can be bikes, trees, or really any structure with some gaps between).
- Discs: One as a marker and as many Arias/Discrafts as you have

Set up the target as far away from the obstacles as [your average in-game throw + 10 yards]. From the target, throw the marker past the obstacles. Some people like to use a roller throw so that the position behind the obstacles is a bit randomized. The marker tells you where your pivot foot should be. Then, throw each of your discs back into the target using the obstacles to determine the best flight path for the disc.

### Intermediate level

Throw each disc (instead of the marker) towards the obstacles, and make the target throws in succession from each of the disc positions so that you have to flexibly analyze the obstacles/target and adjust in turn.

### Expert level

Like everything else in Ultimate, this is mostly just “intermediate plus being tired”. Run a 30-30-30-30 shuttle or some other 30-second vigorous exercise and then complete the course.

 

Were you able to try one of these homeworks over the week? How challenging was it, and what did it force you to do or to think about? Let me know in the comments! 



# Extra: More about transitions

While we spend most of our time thinking about what we want to do on offense or defense, it is the transition time between possessions that can decide games. Handlers have a number of roles to play in transitions, and your smaller efforts to help your team in those situations can have more impact on the final score than by huge amounts of training on either O or D alone. Here are some things to think about and a few pieces of homework you might want to try.

 

When your team turns the disc over:

If the other team has a smart fast-break attack, then they can score without needing to navigate your defense. We need to ensure that, at the least, each of our defenders get a chance. Since handlers are typically matched up with handlers, they become the most likely first mark in a turnover situation.

 

As the now-defender, you should be looking around for the easiest first throw even before the disc hits the ground! This is especially true on hucks to the endzone, where you lose nothing by planning your defense and then being ‘disappointed’ by your teammate’s successful catch. In any of these situations, find the next easiest useful throw and try to stop it. This may prevent the fast-break entirely or at least cause the new thrower to pause. You may consider allowing early yardage-losing throws or difficult hucks into the wind, depending on the situations. In almost all cases, throws to wide open stationary receivers and/or receivers in the middle of the field are the most damaging to a scattered defense.

 

## Homework

Discuss these situations with a teammate. On the sideline after a point, have a quick discussion of how you reacted in that moment and if it helped. This isn’t the glorious hard-running drill that many of us enjoy, but it is a way to build in-the-moment instinct.

 

If the new offense takes their time, then handlers have a number of responsibilities:

·    Make sure everyone on defense knows the force. When you make this clear, remember that transitions are confusing times and some players (especially if intimidated by the moment or feeling guilty from their turnover) will need more time and perhaps more forceful reminders to get them to position correctly. Avoid sarcasm or emotionally charged statements, and simply/clearly deliver the information at least twice.

·    With the mark established, you may have time to assess matchups. If you see a particularly terrible one (their dominant deep against your slowest player, for example, or their star handler against your newest) then you might be able to orchestrate a switch. For borderline matchups, don’t do anything: focused defenders are better than a marginal matchup advantage, and your switching players around will add a bit to their mental load. Just look to solve the worst matchups if you can.

·    See the formation of the offense. Are they setting up a side stack or a horizontal? One reset handler or two? You may be given fairly obvious clues as to where the first look is going to be. If you see an obvious clue, tell the defender most likely to be involved. Usually, informing them that ‘your player is probably cutting under’ is better than ‘No under!’, because it gives them information without dictating their response which is both a more positive way to treat them and allows them to make further, better decisions based on data you may not have (for example, if they have eye contact with a different defender they may be able to plan a bracket or switch).

·    Relatedly, listen for the play call. Often, the opponent’s plays will be some word or phrase that is meaningless to you….the first time. You might well pick up on a clue that will help later in the game, weekend or year. There is no ultimate rule against listening to the words that are coming out of the other team’s mouth. If you have the headspace and time to listen, you can often hear simple un-coded plans in transition. Heck, you can often hear the play call of an offense from 70 yards away (especially from team captains who are heavy on the testosterone).

·    Lastly, encourage your teammates if possible. A simple “Let’s get this” or “Oooh, this is our time to get a block” or something positive and enthusiastic can go a long way to healing the mental damage caused by a turnover.

 

## Homework

\1. If you have game footage with video, review the moments after a turnover. Things you should note are:

a. Who is talking?

b. How much time did they have?

c. How much time did it take to transmit information?

d. Were they organized when the disc came in?

\2. If you are watching strong players play, try to resist the urge to emotionally respond to turnovers. Let the hecklers display their command of comedy while you just watch what the handlers do. Transition instinct is uncommon precisely because we all spend energy reacting to the reason for the transition. If you can watch games to learn more about these moments, you are both gaining expertise as well as training yourself in that same skill of being in the moment.

 

### When your opponent turns the disc over:

As a handler, you’ll be the coach on the field making decisions about what to do with the disc. That is a fairly precise calculus, as you need to examine two different universes and compare their likely outcomes. In one universe, you pick it up quickly. The control group is your average stopped-disc possession from that same spot on the field.

 

For example, if the opponent turns it over in the middle of the field near their own endzone, then you should virtually never pick that disc up early. Your endzone offense is very likely to score relatively to other possessions. You should only be fast-breaking if you have a clear goal that is obviously better than an organized simple possession. Yet, this is when fast-breaks are most common as players compare the wrong universes: Fast-breaking vs ‘I don’t get to throw it’. As a handler, you may need to be the player who coaches teammates to set up a working formation here.

 

If you are going to pick up the disc quickly, you should already see the player to whom you are going to throw. Picking up the disc without an option is a guarantee that you’ll waste stalling time trying to read the field. Since you don’t want to go backwards, this means that you are probably always going to be looking towards your goal before you pick up the disc. If you aren’t, don't!

See an option and want to fast-break? Go for it…but be ready to stop that motion up until the point you touch the disc. You can always back away. While you can’t stand over the disc and survey the field, you can walk away from the disc as you make the decision at any point not to pick it up. This is the part that most young handlers have the most difficult time with: using as much of your time as you need. Take that 10 (or 20, or more!) seconds of pre-stall and use what you need to get exactly what you want. Too often, handlers feel a kind of gravity towards picking up the disc and can’t feel the rest of their team begging for a few more seconds.

 

### You should use that time to:

·    Breathe!

·    Find obvious mismatches that you might use to call a play.

·    Call for a start to your offense. In a perfect world, you have a player making a first cut ~1 second before you pick up the disc to give you maximum time to see their cut and find defensive rotations. They can only do this if you tell them the play well in advance. It is usual for a cutter to need 4-5 seconds after the play call is repeated 2-3 times to understand their role…that adds up to almost the entire pre-stall. If you aren’t calling the play until you are ready to throw, then you are nearly sure to have no good cut before you need to look for a safety-valve throw.

·    See the entire field. Take the moment to look all the way around you. You may find wide players you didn’t expect near the sidelines, or a help defender deep that you need to avoid.

·    Reposition players to get the formation you want. This is especially true if the opponent

·    Breathe again. Then play.

 

## Homework

The motions of walking to a disc, approaching slowly, calling a play and then starting the possession will happen in the most confusing moment of the game…practice them! 2-3 solitary run-throughts per week will only take you a minute, total, and can help to make these motions routine and subconscious. Did you find yourself taking all of your time, or remembering to call a play as early as possible?

 

One last thought here: It can be very useful for handlers behind the disc to say “I’ve got it”. This gives your team the option to defer to you. Strong teams still give their players the freedom to pick the disc up and go if that is the best option. Every so often, a call of ‘No fast-break, I’ll pick it up” can get defenders to relax enough to actually make the fast-break much easier. In the same vein of thought, you may have some players on your team who are very unlikely to ever pick up the disc on a turnover. If your team knows this, those players can be free to make fake fast-break pickups that rattle the other team and prevent their handlers and coaches from all of the good communication that they’d otherwise do.

##  Homework for picking up the disc

·    From an individual standpoint, this very specific throw can easily be worked into your throwing or track/agility/strength workouts. Have a target, and then do something that makes you physically tired (a 40-40-40 works just fine for most people). Pick up the disc at the end of it and make the throw. 1-2 of these per month will do wonders for your mentality when you have to do it in the moment.
