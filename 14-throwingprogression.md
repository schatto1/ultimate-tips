# Throwing Progressions that Transfer to the Field (Mario O'Brien)

# week 1 - Intro to Throwing Progressions

## Overview, Intro and Context

### - Reading patterns, making it instinct

Being a great thrower is mainly about 2 things, decision making and technical ability. One comes before the other, and that's where we're starting. We're going to create a mental framework for recognizing patterns, for how and when we make decisions.

The greatest players don't think while they're playing, it's almost entirely instinct. That means we have to train our capacity to recognize patterns and act. We can train our thoughts to become instinct, to in turn become muscle memory. We need to train ourselves to read and react. The first step is grooving and learning the patterns.

We need to know and dive into the the most common patterns, and come up with a consistent way to think through those situations. We'll call this idea a throwing progression. We'll apply different throwing progressions to different situations, so that when we see those patterns start to unfold on the field, the decisions we make feel natural, trained, instinctive.

## Defining a Throwing Progression

**A throwing progression is:** A way to organize our throwing target priorities (aka where we’re looking) based on game-situational context (the what and why) and the stall count (the when).

### Very Basic Example

**It’s not a rule, it’s a guideline.** Think of a throwing progression as a default that’s always modifiable and changeable. The goal is to eventually make our defaults instinctive, so that we can focus more attention on reading situations and reacting.

**Understanding and applying nuance.** The example above is an extremely rough guideline, our goal will be to eventually get into the nuance of each stall count, especially early in the stall count when looking downfield.

We'll look at 3 key situations that cover a broad range of offensive roles:

- Aggressive handler progressions
- Ball movement throwing progressions
- Cutter throwing progressions

Once we have a framework for those progressions, we'll train them with repetition. Then we’ll apply situational context and nuance of our own role within our own system to get into the details of how and why we make decisions. With every situation we'll ask ourselves questions like:

- Where on the field should I be looking? when?
- How can I best create an advantage, but minimize the risk of a turnover?
- What is the defense likely thinking or trying to do in this situation?

## Homework: Identifying YOUR most common situations

Think about the offensive role you play on your team and identify the 2 most common situations you find yourself in when you catch the disc. Describe where you are, what you can see, what your defender and other defenders are most likely doing and the throwing options you have.

Post your answers in the comments below!

**Mario’s example:** As a secondary O-line handler, I’m normally catching disc in the middle of the field off a reset throw that’s moving from the force sideline towards the break sideline. My defender is usually scrambling to takeaway the breakside and then setting the mark. If I don’t swing immediately, I look downfield. I often see our vertical stack in the middle of the field and a cutter who’s just finished his clear back into the stack. The stack is often a bit deeper than I’d like because my reset cut usually ends up slightly in the backfield. The vert stack defenders are on the force side of their person trying to take away easy open-side unders, and I’m looking and waiting for a cutter to isolate themselves and create separation from their defender. At stall 5 I start looking to my reset, as prescribed by our handler reset system guidelines for our team.



# week 2 - Aggressive Handler Possessions

## Defining an Aggressive Handler

If you’re a primary handler on your team, you’re very like an aggressive handler. Aggressive handlers are comfortable hucking, comfortable breaking the mark, and obviously throwing anything to the open side underneath space. Aggressive handlers get a lot of touches throughout the game, lots of times in the middle of the field.

## Setting a Context

Overly general throwing progressions (i.e. stall 1-4 downfield, stall 5-10 reset) are good for learning, but they don’t help us level-up. What we need to do is think through and identify several of the game variables so that we can get a clear picture of what we actually would be seeing during the game, then we’ll build our throwing progressions. Here’s where it gets tricky, because everyone’s team has slight differences. I’m going to model how I think through the variables of what I typically see when playing horizontal offense as an aggressive handler with the disc in the middle of the field.

## Mario’s Hori Stack Context

- What is the defense doing and thinking in this situation? I am the center handler and we’re running a pull play, centering to me, against a force forehand mark. I see the cutter defenders are tight and playing slightly underneath. I see no deep help, which means the rail cutters are also being guarded closely, and there’s no handlers flashing in the lane. This is straight hard person D, everything looks tight and pretty clean. The defense is thinking they can shut down the individual cuts with good anticipation and 1v1 footwork. This means that my huck windows will likely be big, but I can’t float it otherwise the tight D will make a play. Also my break windows are going to be small and close fast.
- How can I best create an advantage, but minimize the risk of a turnover? Since we’re running a pull play initiating with the middle two cutters, and my team needs me to stick to the script here, minimizing the risk, but being aggressive if I have an opportunity. No improv, gotta check through each look to the cutters, hit it if it’s there and in rhythm. If my deep look has a couple steps, I’m throwing it, this is why I’m in this role. If it’s not there I’m either pump faking hard to bring the cutter in OR looking to the secondary break look. If it’s not there, trust the reset system to get us an advantage, move the ball with an easy throw, change the angle of attack.  
- Where on the field should I be looking? When? This is where it gets fun, and super nuanced based on your set or your team’s offense. On [this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wlmSm16aR_8iciGnuXNFBLo4CWv-K2iMTDxiFJsRWAI/edit?usp=sharing), in line 3 I have the a detailed framework for how I think through the progression. Then I’ve listed out several possibilities for what I might end up doing, all based on that initial framework. And voilet, those are the things I’m going to go practice.

As you watch the video, see if you can pick out which possibility I’m working on. I don’t do them in the exact same order as they’re written, sometimes I mess up, and I even added some progressions out of motion or after a throw-and-go.  I also switch to practicing against a backhand force about halfway through, but it’s tough to tell because I still stand showing my forehand. This is something I do in games because I am more comfortable and can see more while standing in my ‘forehand-ready’ stance than my backhand-ready stance.

##  Homework

Write and practice your own ‘aggressive handler’ throwing progression based on you and your team. When writing it out, be sure to answer the 3 questions. 

1. What is the defense doing and thinking in this situation?
2. How can I best create an advantage, but minimize the risk of a turnover?
3. Where on the field should I be looking? When? You can copy paste mine from the sheet if you want.

**Now go practice!** I’d recommend at least 2-3 times through each progression. You can do it in as little as 10-15 minutes, and even do a walking version at home in your room if you want!





# week 3 - Ball Movement Progressions

# Defining a ball movement handler (aka secondary handler, aka primary reset)

If you’re almost always catching the disc in motion off a reset, or you’re rarely centered to on a pull play, or you rarely pick up the disc off a turnover, that’s a ball movement handler. The key super power of a ball movement handler is being able to maintain and strengthen your advantage against your mark in the first moments after catching the disc. Key to your skillset is the ability to read and react in order to gain an advantage.

 

# Mario’s BALL MOVEMENT hori-stack context

- **What is the defense doing and thinking in this situation?** I am the primary reset handler and the disc is on the force sideline. I cut upline and catch the disc in a power position, on the force side somewhere near the sideline. At the moment of catching the disc, when I look downfield, there’s a lot happening. I see cutters spread out horizontally, but at different depths, and relatively close to me because my forward momentum got me downfield. I see person to person defense and defenders who are in the process of repositioning based on the motion of the cutters. I also (very likely) see a cutter who’s in a great position to strike deep, because that’s something we practice and teach our cutters to cue off of. My mark is trailing me and right on my heels because they just got beat upline. Around stall 5, I would expect my mark to rotate into a trap mark position, because I’m on the sideline.
- **How can I best create an advantage, but minimize the risk of a turnover?** Ideally, I’m throwing a huck immediately if I see a well timed deep cut, because hucks from power position are normally a better idea than hucks not from forward momentum. If I don’t get the huck off, I’m thinking ‘find an easy look OR get it off the sideline for an easy reset before they put on the trap’. This means I might square up to my reset one stall count earlier than normal to see if I can beat the trap mark before it’s set.
- **Where on the field should I be looking? When?** At the moment I catch it, I’m already starting my windup and throwing motion, even if I’m not sure at that I’m going to throw it.  This sets me up to either a) throw immediately when I get it, OR b) create a read-and-react situation where I take advantage of the mark’s momentary poor positioning. Best case scenario is I’m throwing the huck, in rhythm, on balance, immediately after catching. But if I don’t, I’ll hopefully get the mark to bite hard on the huck fake, and then I’ll have a moment to look at the middle of the field for a shallow break look. Both of these looks continue to press my advantage over my defender. [Here's how I break down the different options and the possibilities.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wlmSm16aR_8iciGnuXNFBLo4CWv-K2iMTDxiFJsRWAI/edit?usp=sharing)


Here’s me practicing the upline reset progression

Here’s me practicing another situation where I don’t go upline, and instead cut backfield and catch disc in middle of field

**Homework Part 1 (10-20 min):** Create 2 of YOUR OWN throwing progressions (like mine here) based on the offense you run and the situations you see. Feel free to take mine and modify it if you’d like.


**Homework Part 2 (20-30min):** Practice your 2 situations. Ideally you get outside, but you can do this in your living room if you want. If you do it inside, you actually don’t need to walk or cut too much but definitely good to do the movements basic movements of the cuts, pivots, fakes, etc.

# week 4 - Cutter Thrower Progressions

# Cutter Thrower Progressions

At the moment of the catch, cutter thrower progressions are the most dynamic because there are so many different scenarios and nuances to what you see and how the defense is reacting. After the first two stall counts, the progressions are similar to handlers. However, since there are so many different angles you might be running to make the catch (i.e. under slightly towards the open side, under slightly to the break side, horizontally to the breakside), there are lots of different ways you can try to maintain and gain advantage over the mark while they’re positioning to take away angles.


**Using your momentum: gaining,** **maintain, and extending your momentary advantage**

Instead of diving in deep on one specific situation, instead I want to show you several different ways you can use the first 1-2 seconds after you catch the disc to envision and get comfortable as a cutter who needs to make the next throw.


**Key Tips:**

- Continue the momentum of where the disc was taking you and begin a throwing motion immediately after catching
- Immediately threaten the most dangerous space (i.e. the place where the D doesn’t want the disc to go)

 

*Note: All videos below are assuming force forehand and running horizontal offense


**Middle of the field under cuts (big gain) with momentum to open side**

Immediately threaten the deep space.

**Middle of the field under cuts (big gain) with momentum to break side**

Immediately threaten the around breakside in order to move the mark, then square up to downfield.

**Shallow (i.e. not a big gain) middle of field under cuts**



Since the handlers are close, look for a quick streaking handler immediately after the catch. Their downfield momentum potentially turns into power position.

**Middle of field, moving horizontally to breakside**



Threaten the around breakside immediately, then look downfield.

**Assignment Part 1 (5-7 min):**



With a partner, talk about being a cutter in your offense and decide which are the most common scenarios that YOU find yourself in, and what you should immediately threaten when you catch the disc. Talk about the continuation looks that should ideally be happening. Have your partner ask you questions like:

- When you catch the disc in that situation what will you immediately look for?
- If the defense over-reacts to your initial motion after you catch, where will you threaten and look?
- What type of throw would you most likely use for a continuation? Big huck? Shallow huck? Around break? Underneath easy forehand?

**Assignment Part 2 (20-40 min)**

Do some real time walkthroughs of your different progressions with your partner as the continuation cutter. For any given situation, for the first few, tell your partner what type of cut to do and them the shape and timing. After they understand a few different options for 1 scenario, let them choose the cut they’ll do, and you (the thrower) can read and react to their cut.
