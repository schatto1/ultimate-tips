# Fundamentals of Changing Direction (Melissa Witmer)

# week 1 - Part 1: Your current form

The purpose of this activity is to record what your change of direction looks like right now. Without any research, I just want you to do what currently comes naturally to complete the 5-10-5 agility drill explained above.

In my explanation, I jog through the drill so you know where to go. You should do the drill at your top speed.

### **To do the drill**

1. Start at the center cone in the athletic position with your hips and shoulders facing forward (perpendicular to the direction you'll be moving). 
2. Run 5 yards (or meters) in one direction
3. Run 10 yards the other direction
4. Run 5 yards back to the center cone.

 

## Homework

Record your 5-10-5 drill on video. If you're brave, post it in the comments below!



# week 1 - Part 2: Your positioning

This week we’re going to...

- Get comfortable in the athletic position (see homework)
- Learn about the hockey stop position (by watching the video above)
- Wake up the connection between our feet and our brain with a few quick footwork drills while maintaining and athletic position. (First part of exercise module below)
- Gain strength and stability in the hockey stop position. (Second part of exercise module below)
- Become more aware of what being in the hockey stop position feels like. (Second part of exercise module below)

 

## Homework

Part 1. Get comfortable in the athletic position by incorporating it into your daily life.

### Part 2 Do this module 2-3 times this week

Do this module after a short dynamic warm up for best results. Or just fit in the exercises whenever you can!

**First part:** maintain athletic position while working on quick feet.

*Think about keeping your center of mass at the same height and between the balls of your feel as they move lightly underneath you.*

\1. Fast feet 10 seconds

\2. Rest 40 seconds and repeat the fast feet exercise

\3. Rest 40 seconds

\4. Lateral fast feet 10 seconds

\5. Rest 40 seconds and repeat the lateral fast feet exercise

\6. Rest 40 seconds and move on to the second part below.

**Second part:** becoming familiar with the hockey stop position

\1. Hockey stop position with 3 touches. 5 reps each leg

\2. Rest 30 seconds

\3. Hockey stop position one touch. 8 reps each leg

\4. Rest 30 seconds

Repeat 1-4 another time through.





# week 2 - Hip and Footwork

This week we are going to...

- Gain a better feel and understanding of what it means to keep the hips open.
- Get comfortable with getting the feet farther outside the center of mass in tight turns.
- Cue yourself to “get low” as you decelerate to a stop

##   Homework

This session should be done twice a week after a dynamic warmup.

***Thirty second rest between reps. Two minutes rest between sets and exercises.\***

###  5-10 Drill



<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LG3SkWKKLHk?rel=0" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" style="box-sizing: border-box; position: absolute; top: 0px; bottom: 0px; left: 0px; width: 640px; height: 360px; border: 0px; background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"></iframe>




2 sets of 4 repetitions. 

Drill setup is three cones in a line each 5 yards apart. Do two reps facing each direction. Keep hips open (not committed to the cone)

### Short Shuttle

2 sets of of one repetition.

Cones are about 10 yards apart. Touch each cone 3 times for one repetition. Remember to touch the cones with the inside hand. Feet should go past the cone as your center of mass stays over the cone.

###  Short Slalom

2 sets of 4 reps 

Set up 4 cones about 4 yards apart in a diagonal pattern. Turns should feel slightly too tight. Focus on staying low. As your feet move outside the cones, your center of mass should be over the cones.

### Deceleration

2 sets of 2 repetitions

Decelerating to a stop from 15 yards. Keep your hips square (pointing in the direction of motion). Focus on getting your hips low and observe how you shift your weight and chop your feet (take small quick steps as you decelerate). Do not try too hard to control what your body is doing. Simply become more aware of what your body is doing.

# week 3 - Putting it Together

This week you'll be practicing the complete 5-10-5 drill. the purpose of this drill is to gain greater awareness and control of the hips. It's okay to do this drill slowly a few times to get the hang of it. As a hint, most times people err on the side of starting to open the hips too late. Cue yourself to start opening the hips as soon as you pass the middle cone.

 

## Change of Direction Practice

Do this module twice this week

Rest 30 seconds between repetitions and 2 minutes between sets.

### 5-10-5 practice

See video above for demonstration and explanation

2 sets of 4 repetitions. Twice facing each direction

### 15-5 Practice

 

Purpose: Work on decelerating and opening the hips from a higher speed

Run 15 yards to a cone, decelerate as you approach the done and change direction at various angles.

2 sets of 4 repetitions.

Twice each direction (right to left and left to right)

For each set, change the angle of the change of direction. (ex, 2 X 120 degrees, 2X 160 degrees)

You will be using the same technique as you use in the 5-10-5 drill. At the point of direction change you should find yourself in the hockey stop position.

 

## Homework:

option 1: Dive us a post-workout selfie in the comments!

option 2: Do you notice anything that could be improved about the form being demonstrated in today's video?



# week 4 - Evaluation and Practice

This week we are going to re-evaluate our change of direction and simply get more practice at what we've learned so far.

##  Change of Direction Module

Do this module twice this week

Rest 30 seconds between repetitions and 2 minutes between sets

 

### 5-10-5

2 sets of 4 repetitions. Twice facing each direction for each set

 

### **Zigzag drill**



<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YdgYleKenGM?rel=0" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" style="box-sizing: border-box; position: absolute; top: 0px; bottom: 0px; left: 0px; width: 640px; height: 360px; border: 0px; background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"></iframe>



1 sets of 4 repetitions

Don't worry about getting the cone setup exactly right. the point is to change direction at a variety of angles.

 


Heads up! These are exercises for your nervous system so you do not need a high volume to elicit adaptation! If you want to do an extra set of zigzags, that is fine. But do not turn this into a conditioning workout or you will not get faster as quickly.

## Homework

- Re-film your 5-10-5 drill. Does it look any different?
- Do you feel more agile and in control in your change of direction?
- Post any comments or questions still have about changing direction.
